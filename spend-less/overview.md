# Spend Less: Overview

## The Goal

Save **$1000** for **Steam Frame** by **March 1st, 2026**.

Not about deprivation. About redirecting impulse spending toward something you actually want.

## Current State → Target

| Level | Description | You |
|-------|-------------|-----|
| L1 | Spend, notice later in Monarch | |
| **L2** | Notice in the moment but buy anyway | **← Now** |
| L3 | Pause sometimes, impulse still wins often | |
| **L4** | Default is pause. Most impulse purchases don't happen. | **← Target** |
| L5 | Spending is intentional. Impulse buying feels foreign. | |

## The Gaps (From Diagnostic)

| Gap | Fix |
|-----|-----|
| Saved payment methods everywhere | Don't save new card anywhere |
| Don't know danger zones | Track triggers for 2 weeks |
| No pause mechanism | 24-hour rule on anything >$20 |
| No weekly review | 10-min Monarch check |
| YouTube triggers buying urge | Unfollow/block specific channels |

---

## The Math

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Target | $1000 |
| Weeks | 11 |
| Per week | ~$91 |

This isn't "save $91 extra" - it's "don't waste $91 on impulse buys you'd regret."

## 4 Phases

| Phase | Weeks | Focus | Key Action |
|-------|-------|-------|------------|
| **1: Friction Reset** | 1-3 | Environment | Don't save new card. Remove old saved methods. |
| **2: Know Your Triggers** | 4-6 | Awareness | Log every impulse (bought or not). Find patterns. |
| **3: The Pause Rule** | 7-9 | Behavior | 24-hour wait on anything >$20 |
| **4: Sustain + Review** | 10-11 | Habit | Weekly Monarch review. Prep for Steam Frame purchase. |

## Weekly Check-in (Phase 4)

Every Sunday, 10 min in Monarch:

1. **Discretionary spending this week:** $___
2. **Impulse purchases avoided:** $___
3. **Running total saved:** $___
4. **On track for Steam Frame?** Yes / No / Ahead

---

## Success Metrics

- **Primary:** $1000 saved by March 1
- **Secondary:** Can identify your top 3 triggers
- **Bonus:** Impulse purchases feel weird, not tempting

---

## Key Principle

> **You're not saying "no" to spending. You're saying "yes" to Steam Frame.**

Every $30 impulse buy is 1/3 of a week's progress gone.
