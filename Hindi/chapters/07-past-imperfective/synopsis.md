# Unit 7: Past Imperfective

## Key Concepts

### The Past Imperfective
- Formation: Imperfective Participle + tha/thi/the/thin
- Used for habitual past actions ("used to")
- Example: mai tujhe khat likhta tha (I used to write you letters)
- Participle agrees with subject in gender/number
- Routine imperfective (without tha) used for indefinite timescales in narratives

### Koi and Kuch
- koi = someone (human/countable), kuch = something (inanimate/uncountable)
- Negatives: koi nahi = nobody, kuch nahi = nothing
- koi + singular noun = some/a certain
- Oblique: koi -> kisi (only singular)
- kuch as adverb = rather/a bit (yah kuch mota hai = this is rather fat)
- koi + number = approximately (koi das = about ten)

### Chahiye (is wanted/needed)
- Construction: Wanter + ko + wanted thing + chahiye
- Thing wanted is grammatical subject
- Past: chahiye + tha/thi/the/thin (agrees with wanted thing)
- Example: dadi ko naya chashma chahiye (Grandma needs new glasses)

### Ordinal Numbers
- Add -va suffix to cardinals: barahva (twelfth), bisva (twentieth)
- Inflect like adjectives: -vi (f), -ve (m oblique/plural)
- Sanskrit ordinals for formal use: pratham (first), dvitiya (second)

### Aggregatives
- Formation: number + -o suffix for "all X of them"
- dono = both, tino bacce = all three children
- Also for large multiples: saikro = hundreds of, hazaro = thousands of

### Conjunct Verbs
- Noun/Adj + karna (transitive) vs hona (intransitive)
- kam shuru karna = to begin work (active)
- kam shuru hona = work begins (passive/intrinsic)

## Vocab Theme
Family terms, childhood memories, office settings, rooms, seasons (garmi ka mausam), languages (urdu, angrezi), time expressions

## Dialogue Context
- 7a: Sangeeta talks with grandmother about childhood in Kanpur - nostalgia, family languages, cinema trips with friends
