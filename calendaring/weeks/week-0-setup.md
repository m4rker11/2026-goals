# Week 0: Infrastructure Day

**Time commitment:** 1-2 hours (one-time)
**When to do this:** Before Week 1 starts
**Goal:** Set up all automation so the system works FOR you

---

## The Philosophy

Every minute spent on infrastructure saves hours of willpower later. These are "set and forget" - do once, benefit forever.

---

## Phase 1: Phone Setup (20 min)

### 1.1 Calendar Widget on Home Screen

**Why:** See today's events every time you unlock phone. Passive exposure.

- [ ] Add Google Calendar widget to main home screen
- [ ] Make it large enough to show 3-4 events
- [ ] Position it where your eyes naturally go

### 1.2 Google Tasks Widget

- [ ] Add Google Tasks widget to home screen (or second screen)
- [ ] Consider: Calendar widget on screen 1, Tasks on screen 2

### 1.3 Test Voice Commands

**Why:** Friction kills habits. Voice = instant capture.

- [ ] Test: "Hey Siri/Google, add to calendar: Dentist tomorrow at 2pm"
- [ ] Test: "Hey Siri/Google, add reminder: Call mom at 5pm"
- [ ] If it doesn't work, troubleshoot permissions now

### 1.4 Default Notifications

**Why:** Multiple reminders = harder to miss. One reminder = easily ignored.

- [ ] Open Google Calendar → Settings → Events
- [ ] Set default notifications: **10 minutes, 1 hour, 1 day**
- [ ] For all-day events: notification at **9am day before**

---

## Phase 2: Browser Setup (5 min)

### 2.1 Homepage = Calendar

**Why:** Every time you open browser, you see your day.

- [ ] Chrome: Settings → On startup → Open specific page → `calendar.google.com`
- [ ] Set new tab page to calendar (may need extension like "New Tab Redirect")

---

## Phase 3: Calendar Settings (15 min)

### 3.1 Color Coding

**Why:** See at a glance what type of day you have.

Create these calendars (or just use colors):
- [ ] **Work** (blue) - meetings, deadlines
- [ ] **Personal** (green) - gym, personal blocks
- [ ] **Social** (purple) - friends, dates, family
- [ ] **Health** (red) - doctor, PT, medical
- [ ] **Anuska** (orange) - shared events, her stuff that affects you

### 3.2 Work Calendar Sync

- [ ] If work uses Google Workspace: already synced
- [ ] If work uses Outlook: Add calendar → Subscribe → Use ICS link
- [ ] Or: Forward meeting invites to personal gmail

### 3.3 Travel Time

- [ ] Settings → Enable "Speedy meetings" (optional: 25/50 min defaults)
- [ ] When adding events: tap "Add location" to auto-calculate travel

---

## Phase 4: Google Tasks Setup (20 min)

**Why front-load this:** You already do todos. This just centralizes them so they appear on your calendar automatically.

### 4.1 Install Apps

**Android:**
- [ ] Install "Google Tasks" app from Play Store
- [ ] Pin it to home screen or dock

**Mac/Linux:**
- [ ] Open calendar.google.com in Chrome
- [ ] Click ⋮ menu → "Install Google Calendar" (creates PWA)
- [ ] Or: Use tasks.google.com as a PWA
- [ ] Or: If using Raycast, install Google Tasks extension

### 4.2 Enable Tasks in Calendar View

- [ ] Open Google Calendar (web)
- [ ] Left sidebar: ensure "Tasks" checkbox is visible and checked
- [ ] Tasks with due dates now appear on your calendar

### 4.3 Create Task Lists

- [ ] **Daily** - stuff that must happen today
- [ ] **This Week** - to get done this week, no specific day
- [ ] **Recurring** - weekly/monthly stuff (or use repeating tasks)
- [ ] **Someday** - parking lot for ideas

### 4.4 Test the Flow

- [ ] Add a test task: "Test task" with due date = tomorrow
- [ ] Open Google Calendar → verify it appears on tomorrow
- [ ] Complete the task → verify it disappears from calendar

### 4.5 Voice Command Test

- [ ] "Hey Google/Siri, remind me to [X] at [time]"
- [ ] Check if it lands in Tasks or Reminders (may need to configure)

### 4.6 Migrate Existing Todos (Optional)

If you have todos scattered elsewhere:
- [ ] Identify where they live now (notes app, mental, sticky notes)
- [ ] Move the active ones into Google Tasks
- [ ] Don't over-organize - just get them in one place

---

## Phase 5: Smart Home Integration (15 min)

*Skip if you don't have Google Home/Alexa*

### 5.1 Google Home

- [ ] Open Google Home app → Settings → Services → Calendar
- [ ] Link Google Calendar account
- [ ] Test: "Hey Google, what's on my calendar today?"
- [ ] Test: "Hey Google, what's my next meeting?"

### 5.2 Set Up Broadcast Reminders

- [ ] Google Home can announce: "You have a meeting in 10 minutes"
- [ ] Enable calendar notifications in Google Home settings

---

## Phase 6: Smartwatch Setup (if applicable)

- [ ] Ensure calendar app syncs to watch
- [ ] Enable haptic notifications for events
- [ ] Test: create test event 2 min from now, feel the tap

---

## Verification Checklist

Before moving to Week 1, confirm:

- [ ] When I unlock phone, I see today's calendar
- [ ] Voice command adds events successfully
- [ ] Browser opens to calendar
- [ ] Events have 3 default reminders (10 min, 1 hr, 1 day)
- [ ] Work calendar is visible
- [ ] Google Tasks is visible in calendar
- [ ] (Optional) Smart home announces events
- [ ] (Optional) Watch taps me for events

## Infrastructure Levels Achieved

After completing this day:

| Track | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| D: Infrastructure | D1 | D4-D5 |

You've gone from "calendar exists" to "calendar is everywhere and reminds you automatically."

---

## What's Next

Week 1 focuses on ONE behavior: **Morning calendar check**.

All this infrastructure makes that check effortless - you'll see the calendar whether you try to or not.
