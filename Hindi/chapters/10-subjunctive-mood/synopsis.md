# Unit 10: Subjunctive Mood

## Key Concepts

### The Subjunctive
- Formation: Remove -ga/-gi/-ge from future tense
- Expresses uncertain, speculative, desired, or suggested actions
- mai kuch bolu? = may/should I say something?
- ap yahin rahen = you should stay right here
- Negative uses na (not nahi)
- Masculine and feminine forms identical
- tum subjunctive = tum imperative (same form)

### Subjunctive in ki Clauses
- Used after verbs of hope, expectation, possibility
- mujhe asha thi ki vah patr likhe (I hoped he might write)
- sambhav hai ki tren der se pahunche (train may arrive late)
- hamen ummid hai ki ilaj lamba na ho (we hope treatment won't be long)

### Subjunctive in Auxiliary
- Replace hoga (will/must be) with ho (may be)
- raj so raha ho = Raj may be sleeping
- Comparison: hoga = presumption, ho = possibility/uncertainty

### The Verb Chahna (to want)
- Same subject: use infinitive
  - pitaji ghar jana chahte hain (Father wants to go home)
- Different subjects: use ki + subjunctive
  - pitaji chahte hain ki mai ghar jau (Father wants me to go home)
- Also means "to like/love": sab log tumhen bahut chahte hain

### Conditional Sentences
- Structure: agar (if) + clause... to (then) + clause
- to is mandatory, agar is optional
- Verb form in if-clause shows likelihood:
  - Imperfective: neutral forecast
  - Future: event likely
  - Subjunctive: event less likely
- agar pani pade to = should it rain (unlikely)
- agar pani padega to = if it rains (likely)

### The Suffix -vala
- Attached to nouns: dudhvala (milkman), dillivali (woman from Delhi)
- Attached to adverbs: uparvala kamra (upstairs room)
- Attached to oblique infinitive:
  - Actor: shahar ke rahnevale (townspeople)
  - "About to": dukan band honevali hai (shop is about to close)
- uparvala = God (the one above)

## Vocab Theme
Messages, phone calls, household shopping (kaante, chammach, chhuriya = cutlery), cleaning, family dynamics, formal requests (nivedan)

## Dialogue Context
- 10a: Chotu leaves message for Prakash - Khanna wants to talk, dinner arrangements
- 10b: Sangeeta's dilemma - wants to meet Pinkie but mother wants her home, asking Rishi for advice
- 10c: Kamala's note to Prakash - long list of shopping/cleaning tasks, complaints about family helping
