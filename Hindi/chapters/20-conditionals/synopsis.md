# Chapter 20: Conditionals (The "Agar-To" Logic)

**Focus:** If this, then that

## 20A. Future Conditional (Probable)

### 20A-i. Subjunctive + Future

The elegant B2-level construction uses **subjunctive** in the "if" clause and **future** in the "then" clause.

> **Example:** "Agar vo aaye, to main jaoonga."
> *(If he comes, then I will go.)*

**Key Difference:** Using the subjunctive (*aaye*) for the condition is the sophisticated B2 style.

---

### 20A-ii. Future + Future (Colloquial)

A more common, colloquial pattern uses **future tense in both clauses**.

> **Example:** "Agar vo aayega, to main jaoonga."
> *(If he will come, then I will go.)*

**Key Difference:** This is grammatically heavier but very common in everyday speech.

---

### 20A-iii. Present + Future

Another pattern combines **habitual present** with **future**.

> **Example:** "Agar barish hoti hai, to hum nahin jayenge."
> *(If it rains, then we won't go.)*

---

## 20B. Counter-Factual (Past Unreal)

### 20B-i. "Hota/Hota"

For **contrary-to-fact** conditions (things that didn't happen), use the **imperfective participle** in both clauses.

> **Example:** "Agar tum aate, to main khush hota."
> *(If you had come, I would have been happy.)*

**Key Difference:** This uses the imperfective participle (*aate*, *hota*) for both halves.

---

### 20B-ii. Regret

Counter-factual conditionals often express **regret** about the past.

> **Example:** "Agar maine padha hota..."
> *(If only I had studied...)*

---

### 20B-iii. Mixed Time

It's possible to mix **past unreal conditions** with **present results**.

> **Example:** "Agar usne khaya hota, to ab bhookha na hota."
> *(If he had eaten [past], he wouldn't be hungry [now].)*

---

## 20C. "Jab tak" (Until/Unless)

### 20C-i. Time Condition

*Jab tak* with a negative creates an "until" condition.

> **Example:** "Jab tak tum nahin aaoge, main nahin jaoonga."
> *(Until you come, I won't go.)*

**Key Difference:** Note the **double negative logic** - literally "Until you don't come, I won't go."

---

### 20C-ii. While

*Jab tak* without a negative means "while" or "as long as."

> **Example:** "Jab tak main yahan hoon, chinta mat karo."
> *(As long as I am here, don't worry.)*

---

### 20C-iii. Indefinite

*Jab bhi* expresses "whenever" - an indefinite time condition.

> **Example:** "Jab bhi tum aao, mujhe batana."
> *(Whenever you come, tell me.)*

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Don't use imperative after "Agar"** - use subjunctive or future
2. **Remember the double negative** with "Jab tak... nahin"
3. **Counter-factuals need imperfective participle** - not simple past
4. **"To" is optional** but adds clarity to complex sentences

---

## Practice Patterns

**Probable Future:**
> Agar [subjunctive], to [future]

**Counter-Factual:**
> Agar [imperfective participle], to [imperfective participle]

**Until:**
> Jab tak [negative], [negative]

**As Long As:**
> Jab tak [positive], [positive]
