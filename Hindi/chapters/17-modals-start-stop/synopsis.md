# Chapter 17: Modals II - Start, Stop & Allow

**Focus:** Controlling the flow of action

---

## 17A. Lagna (To Begin)

### 17A-i. The "Ne" Deletion

When *lagna* is used as an auxiliary to indicate beginning an action, the **"Ne" is removed** even with transitive verbs.

> **Example:** "Vo rone laga."
> *(He began to cry.)*

**Key Difference:** Normally transitive verbs in past tense require "Ne," but *lagna* as an auxiliary removes this requirement.

---

### 17A-ii. Infinitive Inflection

The main verb before *lagna* behaves like a noun and takes **infinitive inflection**.

> **Example:** "Barish hone lagi."
> *(Rain started happening.)*

**Key Difference:** The main verb "hone" acts as a noun in this construction.

---

### 17A-iii. "Lagna" as Feeling

*Lagna* is one of the most **versatile verbs** in Hindi. Beyond "to begin," it commonly means "to feel" or "to attach."

> **Example:** "Mujhe thand lag rahi hai."
> *(I am feeling cold.)*

**Key Difference:** Here *lagna* means "to attach/feel" rather than "to begin."

---

## 17B. Dena (To Let)

### 17B-i. Permission

*Dena* as an auxiliary expresses **allowing** or **letting** someone do something.

> **Example:** "Mujhe sone do."
> *(Let me sleep.)*

---

### 17B-ii. With "Ne"

Since *dena* is a transitive verb, the **"Ne" returns** in past tense constructions.

> **Example:** "Usne mujhe jane nahin diya."
> *(He didn't let me go.)*

**Key Difference:** Unlike *lagna* which removes "Ne," *dena* maintains the ergative construction in past tense.

---

### 17B-iii. As "Offer"

*Dena* can also express **offering** or **providing** permission for an action.

> **Example:** "Main karne deta hoon."
> *(I allow it to be done.)*

---

## 17C. Chukna (To Finish)

### 17C-i. Completion Marker

*Chukna* indicates that an action has been **fully completed**.

> **Example:** "Main kha chuka hoon."
> *(I have finished eating.)*

---

### 17C-ii. "Already"

When used with past tense, *chukna* often conveys the meaning of **"already."**

> **Example:** "Vo ja chuke the."
> *(They had already gone.)*

---

### 17C-iii. Alternative to "Liya"

*Chukna* serves a similar function to *liya* for indicating completion.

**Key Difference:** *Chuka* is more **formal and literary** than *liya*.

## Notes on "Ne" Behavior

- **Lagna** removes "Ne" requirement
- **Dena** maintains "Ne" requirement
- **Chukna** is intransitive, so "Ne" is not applicable
