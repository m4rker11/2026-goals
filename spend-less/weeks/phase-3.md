# Phase 3: The Pause Rule (Week 7-9)

**Dates:** Feb 16 - Mar 8
**Focus:** Build the pause habit

---

## The Principle

You know your triggers now. Time to add a simple rule that breaks the impulse cycle.

---

## Phase Tasks

{% include todo-list.html goal="spend-less" unit="phase-3" %}

---

## The 24-Hour Rule

> **Anything over $20 → wait 24 hours before buying.**

That's it. Not "don't buy." Just "wait."

### How to Do It

1. Want something? Add to cart or wishlist.
2. Close the tab.
3. Set a reminder for tomorrow: "Still want [item]?"
4. Tomorrow: If yes, buy it guilt-free. If no, delete and log the save.

---

## The Question

Before any purchase, ask:

> **"Would I rather have this, or be $X closer to Steam Frame?"**

Write it on a sticky note. Put it on your monitor.

## Weekly Targets

| 7 | $91 | Implement 24-hour rule, track how often it stops you |
| 8 | $91 | Notice which items you still want after 24 hours |
| 9 | $91 | The pause should start feeling automatic |
