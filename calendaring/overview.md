# Calendar Mastery: 6-Week Program

## The Goal

Transform calendar from "thing I barely use" to "system that runs my day" through incremental habit building.

## Current State (January 2026)

| Track | Current Level | After Week 0 | Target (6 weeks) |
|-------|---------------|--------------|------------------|
| **A: Input** (things go ON calendar) | A1-A2 | A1-A2 | A5-A6 |
| **B: Todo Integration** | B1 | B3-B4 | B5 |
| **C: Output** (checking calendar) | C1 | C1 | C5-C6 |
| **D: Infrastructure** (automation) | D1 | D4-D5 | D5-D6 |

*Note: B and D jump on Infrastructure Day. A and C build incrementally over 6 weeks.*

## The 4 Tracks

### Track A: Input (What Goes On the Calendar)

| Level | What Gets Added |
|-------|----------------|
| A1 | External fixed-time appointments only |
| A2 | + Add IMMEDIATELY while scheduling |
| A3 | + Social events the moment mentioned |
| A4 | + Daily activities (gym, food duty) |
| A5 | + All details IN event (address, leave time) |
| A6 | + Shared calendar with Anuska |

### Track B: Todo Integration

| Level | Todo System |
|-------|-------------|
| B1 | Todos scattered (mental, notes) |
| B2 | Google Tasks exists, tried once |
| B3 | Some todos in Tasks |
| B4 | Daily todos live in Tasks ecosystem |
| B5 | Weekly review in calendar |
| B6 | Calendar + Tasks = single source |

### Track C: Output (Checking Calendar)

| Level | Frequency |
|-------|-----------|
| C1 | Check when you know something's coming |
| C2 | Morning check (just look) |
| C3 | Morning check is automatic |
| C4 | Check before any new commitment |
| C5 | Morning + evening review |
| C6 | Calendar is ambient awareness |

### Track D: Infrastructure

| Level | Automation |
|-------|------------|
| D1 | Calendar exists on phone |
| D2 | Widget on home screen |
| D3 | Browser homepage = calendar |
| D4 | Multiple reminders default |
| D5 | Smart home announces events |
| D6 | Smartwatch haptic notifications |

## Program Structure

| Week | Focus | Key Behavior |
|------|-------|--------------|
| **0** | Infrastructure Day | Set up automation + Google Tasks (one-time, 1-2 hrs) |
| **1** | Morning Check | Look at calendar every morning |
| **2** | Immediate Input | Add events the MOMENT they're scheduled |
| **3** | Evening Review | Check tomorrow before bed |
| **4** | Daily Activities | Gym, food duty, personal blocks on calendar |
| **5** | Check Before Committing | "Let me check my calendar" becomes reflex |
| **6** | Weekly Planning | Sunday review ritual + Anuska sync |

**Note:** Tasks integration moved to Week 0 since you already have a todo habit - just centralizing it.

## Weekly Check-in Template

Use this with Harshita (Boss as a Service) or for self-reflection:

1. **Compliance:** How many days did I do the target behavior?
2. **Friction:** What made it hard?
3. **Wins:** What worked well?
4. **Adjustments:** What to tweak for next week?
5. **Level check:** Where am I on each track now?
