> **Why this matters:** You need these tone markers immediately after learning basic pronouns.

## 5A. The "To" Deep Dive

### 5A-i. Contrastive Emphasis

> **Example:** "Main to nahin ja raha."

**Meaning:** "I, for one/As for me, am not going." (Implies others might be)

*Difference:* Not "Then". Here it sets the subject apart.

---

### 5A-ii. The "Filler/Softener"

> **Example:** "Suniye to..."

**Meaning:** "Just listen..." / "Listen, won't you?"

*Difference:* Makes commands less harsh.

---

### 5A-iii. Surprise/Obviousness

> **Example:** "Ye to sach hai!"

**Meaning:** "Why, this is true!" (Surprise)

---

## 5B. The "Hi" Exclusivity

### 5B-i. "Only"

> **Example:** "Main hi jaonga."

**Meaning:** Only I will go.

*Difference:* "Sirf main" is also used, but "Main hi" is more native.

---

### 5B-ii. Emphatic Identification

**"Yehi"** (Yeh + Hi), **"Wohi"** (Voh + Hi)

> **Example:** "Yehi kitab chahiye." (This exact book)

---

### 5B-iii. Temporal Immediacy

**"Aate hi"** (As soon as coming)

*Difference:* Verb stem + te + hi = As soon as.

---

## 5C. The "Bhi" & "Tak" (Inclusion/Limits)

### 5C-i. "Bhi" Positioning

> **Example:** "Main bhi Dilli gaya" (I also went) vs "Main Dilli bhi gaya" (I went to Delhi too)

*Difference:* B2 speakers place "Bhi" exactly after the word it emphasizes.

---

### 5C-ii. "Tak" (Even/Until)

> **Example:** "Usne pani tak nahin pucha" (He didn't even ask for water)

*Difference:* Shows extreme limit/rudeness.

---

### 5C-iii. "Tak" (Time limit)

> **Example:** "Kal tak" (By tomorrow/Until tomorrow)
