# Week 11: 200 min Sustained

**Focus:** Fourth week at 200 min - goal complete
**One behavior:** Celebrate and maintain
**Success metric:** 200 minutes total

---

## The Principle

Four weeks at 200 min. The habit is locked in.

You went from ~50 min/week to 200 min/week and held it for a month. **That's a 4x improvement.**
