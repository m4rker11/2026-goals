# Chapter 7: Present Tense Mastery

*Nuances of "Right Now" vs. "Always".*

---

## 7A. The Habitual Present

### 7A-i. Routine: "Ta hai"

> **Example:** "Main office jata hoon."

---

### 7A-ii. Universal Truth

> **Example:** "Suraj purab se nikalta hai."

---

### 7A-iii. Narrating Past Events (Historical Present)

> **Example:** "Phir vo aata hai aur kehta hai..." (Then he comes and says... [telling a story]).

**Key difference:** Using present tense to make a past story vivid.

---

## 7B. The Present Continuous

### 7B-i. Immediate Action: "Raha hai"

> **Example:** "Main kha raha hoon."

---

### 7B-ii. Near Future

> **Example:** "Hum kal ja rahe hain" (We are going tomorrow).

**Key difference:** Certainty of plan allows continuous tense for future.

---

### 7B-iii. Annoyance/Repetition

> **Example:** "Tum hamesha shikayat kar rahe ho!" (You are always complaining).

**Key difference:** Continuous used to emphasize irritation with a habit.

---

## 7C. Stative Verbs (The "Sitting" Trap)

### 7C-i. Body Posture

> **Example:** "Main baitha hoon" (I am sitting/seated).

**Key difference:** NOT *Baith raha hoon* (which means the act of lowering yourself).

---

### 7C-ii. Wearing Clothes

> **Example:** "Usne laal shirt pehni hai" (He is wearing a red shirt).

**Key difference:** State of being dressed vs. act of dressing (*Pehen raha hai*).

---

### 7C-iii. Holding Objects

> **Example:** "Maine bag pakda hua hai" (I am holding a bag).

**Key difference:** *Pakad raha hoon* would mean "I am in the process of grabbing it".
