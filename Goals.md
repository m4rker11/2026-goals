## Hard Goals

### Hindi to B2 Level

I am currently at around A2/early B1 and I need a systematic way to bring myself up to B2. This means:

- **Having a plan** for the topics I want to cover in more detail than just relying on tutors
- **Growing vocabulary** systematically
- **Practice questions** and fill-in-the-blanks exercises to practice along the way

Conversations can be done with tutors mostly for now, but it's also and mostly about having a long-term textbook/plan.

### Get Better at Calendar

Right now the calendar is used more than before but it's still sporadic. What I want to have more of:

- Morning pre-work activities (e.g., a quick run)
- After-work activities (e.g., sauna session)
- Deciding ahead of time who handles food (me or Anuska)
- Events, dates, friend hangouts
- **Daily things** — this is the key gap

**The Problem:** I am barely putting things on the calendar and not checking it often. Using the calendar as a todo list needs to become more specific.

**The Solution:**
- Gradual build-up of things I start putting on the calendar
- Specific about actually checking the calendar — with exact times and moments

### 200 Minutes of Zone 2+ Weekly (excluding PT)

200 min of activity is a little over 3 hours — definitely doable.

**Modified ramp (Jan 2026):** Plateau at 130 min/week for weeks 3-6 to establish routine before ramping to 200 min.

**Personal narrative to overcome:** "I don't know what to do in the gym for a long time" — but I've been consistently proving this wrong. Anuska's gym is small and I've been learning and adding things with nearly every visit.

**The Plan:**
1. Start with lower goals, very granular
2. Build to 130 min/week and hold there for 4 weeks
3. Resume ramp to 200 min in weeks 7-8
4. Plan sessions with Harshita ahead of time

## Medium Goals

### Spend Less

I need to take a hard look at Monarch Money to identify the moments that lead me to overspend.

**Known triggers:**
- YouTube consumption of certain channels → pressure to buy tech and GPUs
- In-the-moment "I can just buy it" decisions

**Action items:**
- Fully commit to NOT watching certain YouTubers in favor of better content (e.g., Minecraft — not purchasable)
- Research how to avoid or handle impulse purchase moments

### Work Boundaries

This ties into calendar changes but also thinking about what APE means for me.

**The dynamic:**
- Our work schedules don't always align
- This mismatch is when time coordination challenges happen between us

**What might help:**
- Be more diligent about morning work start time
- Take inter-work breaks to spend time with Anuska
- Have a set start time
- Know my work into the future (use Linear better) so I can prioritize and increase concurrency
- Stop feeling constantly behind

## Easy Goals

### Trade Every Other Week

This means:
- Having options on what I can trade at any given time (a tradeable timeline)
- Knowing basics of how individual tickers are doing from my tradeable list
- Communicating with BuffedApe about them

**Key principle:** Minimize making things here. Have a routine — like a quick morning check-in — then go on with life.

### Sell Stuff

**Items to sell:**
- Mini PC (old)
- Anuska's main PC
- Roombas
- uConsole RPi400
- Old TV
- Old dryer

**Process:**
1. Collect all items
2. Fix the dryer
3. Put on eBay (if small) or FB Marketplace
4. Bring to Brooklyn postal as needed
5. Done! 💰

### Call Brother Biweekly

Just set a timer and honor it.
