# Week 4: Stop Time + Breaks

**Focus:** Track D (Stop/Breaks Execution)
**One behavior:** Actually stop within 30 min of end time. Take at least one mid-day break.
**Success metric:** Stop within 30 min: 5/7 days. Mid-day breaks: 4+ during week.

---

## The Principle

This is the hard one. You're fighting hyperfocus, the "just one more thing" urge, and the startup voice saying there's always more to do.

But you've built the foundation:
- Week 1: You defined times and gathered evidence that rest helps
- Week 2: Anuska knows your schedule (external accountability)
- Week 3: You proved you can hit a target

Now: apply all of that to the moment it matters most.

## The Two Behaviors

### Behavior 1: Stop Work

At your end time (or within 30 min):
1. **Stop typing mid-sentence if needed** (you can finish tomorrow)
2. **Close the laptop or step away from desk**
3. **Physically move to a different space**

The physical movement matters. If you stay at your desk "just checking something," you'll start working again.

### Behavior 2: Take Breaks

At least once during the work day:
- Step away from work for 10+ minutes
- For cooking, Anuska time, walk, whatever
- NOT scrolling at your desk - actually away

---

## Fighting Hyperfocus

You said you can pause mid-task "almost never unless I take my ADHD meds which I do a third of the time."

So we need strategies for the other 2/3.

### External Interrupts

- **Anuska knock:** Ask her to check on you at end time. "Hey, it's 6" is sometimes enough.
- **Alarm:** Loud, different room if needed. Make yourself get up to silence it.
- **Calendar notification:** Set for 15 min before AND at end time.

### Internal Tricks

- **Leave a breadcrumb:** Stop mid-task on purpose, write one sentence about where you were. Easier to resume = easier to stop.
- **Time boxing the hyperfocus:** "I will ride this wave until [alarm], then surface no matter what."
- **The 2-minute pause:** At end time, stop for 2 minutes. Just stop. Then decide: am I continuing because it's urgent or because I'm in flow? If flow, stop. If urgent, use the "15 more" protocol.

### The "15 More" Protocol (from Week 2)

If you genuinely need more time:
1. Stop at end time
2. Go to Anuska
3. "I need 15 more minutes for [specific thing]. Done by [time]."
4. Actually stop at that time

The rule: you get ONE 15-minute extension, announced in advance. Not "a bit more," not silent continuation.

---

## The Break Strategy

You said you take zero breaks for cooking/Anuska time during work.

Start with ONE. Not a big restructure. Just one break.

### The Trigger

Pick a natural break point:
- After lunch
- Mid-afternoon (2-3pm slump)
- When you complete a task

### The Break

- 10-15 minutes minimum
- Actually step away (not phone-scrolling at desk)
- Do something with Anuska, prep dinner, walk, stretch

### Why Breaks Help Work

This isn't just relationship maintenance. Breaks help code:
- Your subconscious processes problems
- You return with fresh eyes
- Bugs you missed become obvious
- Diminishing returns reset

Remember the evidence you gathered in Week 1. Breaks aren't a sacrifice - they're part of the work.

## Daily Practice

### Throughout Day

- [ ] Take at least one mid-day break (10+ min away from desk)

### End of Day

- [ ] Alarm/notification at end time
- [ ] Stop within 30 minutes
- [ ] If need more time → use "15 more" protocol
- [ ] Physical transition: close laptop, leave desk area

## Daily Tracking

| Day | End time target | Actual stop | Within 30 min? | Used "15 more"? | Break taken? |
|-----|-----------------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Mon | | | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
| Tue | | | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
| Wed | | | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
| Thu | | | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
| Fri | | | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
| Sat | | | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
| Sun | | | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |

## If You Blow Past End Time

It will happen. The question is what you do after.

**Damage control:**
1. When you notice, stop immediately (even if it's 2 hours late)
2. Go to Anuska, acknowledge it: "I lost track, I'm sorry"
3. Note what happened: hyperfocus? no alarm? ignored alarm?

**Prevention for tomorrow:**
- Add more alarms
- Ask Anuska to check on you
- Set a physical barrier (laptop closes at end time via scheduled action?)

**Don't spiral:** One bad day doesn't break the week. Notice, learn, reset.

---

## The Urgency Test

When you want to keep working past end time, ask:

1. Is this truly urgent? (ship deadline tomorrow, production down, etc.)
2. Or do I just want to finish this? (in flow, "almost done," curious)

If #1 → use "15 more" protocol
If #2 → stop anyway. The code will be there tomorrow. Anuska won't.

You said you're "shaky" on distinguishing these. This week, practice the pause. Stop at end time, ask the question, THEN decide.

---

## The Identity Shift

Old identity: "I'm someone who works until I'm done."
New identity: "I'm someone who does focused sprints in a container, then stops."

The second person is:
- More sustainable
- Better partner
- Probably produces similar or better output

You're not becoming less dedicated. You're becoming more disciplined.

## End of Week Reflection

1. **Days stopped within 30 min:** ___/7

2. **Breaks taken this week:** ___

3. **Times I used "15 more" protocol:** ___

4. **What made stopping hard?**
   - [ ] Deep in hyperfocus
   - [ ] "Just one more thing"
   - [ ] Felt guilty about unfinished work
   - [ ] No external interrupt
   - [ ] Ignored the alarm
   - [ ] Other: _______________

5. **What helped?**

6. **Belief check:** Do I believe stopping on time helps my work? (1-10)
   - Week 1 score: ___
   - Now: ___

---

## Level Progress

| Track | Start of Week | End of Week |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| D: Stop/Breaks | D1-D2 | D4-D5 |

**D2:** Stop at "good stopping point" (often 1-2 hours late)
**D4:** Stop within 30 min most days. 1+ break/day.
**D5:** Stop on time. One announced 15-min exception when needed. Breaks happen.

---

## After Week 4

You've completed the 4-week foundation:
- Times defined and believed in
- Anuska knows your schedule
- Start time is consistent
- Stop time is mostly working, breaks happening

**What's next?**

Maintenance. This isn't "done" - it's an ongoing practice. But the habits are forming.

If you want to level up:
- Move to stopping within 15 min (instead of 30)
- Add a second daily break
- Build in "Anuska time" blocks on calendar
- Work toward L5-L6 on all tracks

---

## Connection to Other Goals

Now that work boundaries are working:

- **200 min Zone 2:** Gym happens when work ends on time
- **Calendar Mastery:** Boundaries are ON the calendar
- **Relationship:** Anuska can rely on you being present
- **Spend Less:** Same impulse control muscle

You've built a keystone habit. Protect it.
