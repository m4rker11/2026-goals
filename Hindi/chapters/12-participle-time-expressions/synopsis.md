# Unit 12: Conjunctive Participle and Time Expressions

## Key Concepts

### Conjunctive Participle (jakar = having gone)
- Formation: Verb Stem + -kar or -ke
- Describes first of two sequential events
- English: "and" or "after"
- udhar baithkar aram karo (sit there and rest)
- kofi pikar maine sigreT bhi pi (after drinking coffee I had a cigarette)
- karna always becomes karke: fon karke bataunga (I'll phone and tell)
- Colloquially -kar often replaced by -ke: jake, kholke

### Fixed Phrases with -kar
- hanskar kahna = to say laughingly
- mujhko chorkar = apart from me
- jan-bujhkar = deliberately/on purpose
- se hokar = via
- bhulkar bhi = even by mistake

### Important: Transitivity Independence
- The conjunctive participle does NOT affect ne usage in main clause
- Transitivity of participle is irrelevant to main verb's construction

### Telling Time
- bajne = to strike (for time)
- X baje = at X o'clock: ek baje ao (come at one)
- Minutes before: X bajne men Y minaT = Y to X
  - sat bajne men das minaT hain (it's ten to seven)
- Minutes after: X bajkar Y minaT = Y past X
  - ath bajkar bis minaT hain (it's twenty past eight)
- Traditional: pahar (3-hour watch), dopahar (noon), tisre pahar (afternoon)

### Sakna, Pana, Chukna
- Verb stem + sakna = ability (can/cannot)
  - vah kha sakti hai (she can eat)
- Verb stem + pana = managing to (with effort)
  - mai pura seb ko nahi kha paya (I couldn't eat the whole apple)
  - pana can be used in continuous: mai darwaza nahi khol pa raha hu
- Verb stem + chukna = already completed
  - ham khana kha chuke hain (we have already eaten)
- NONE of these take ne construction
