# Unit 18: Participles Review and Advanced Constructions

## Key Concepts

### Participle Review
This unit consolidates all participle usages from previous chapters:

**Imperfective Participle (-ta/-ti/-te)**
- Ongoing/habitual actions: vah roz ata hai
- Counter-to-fact conditions: mai hota to... (If I were...)

**Perfective Participle (-a/-i/-e)**
- Completed actions: vah aya
- With hona for passive states

**Continuous Constructions**
- Imperfective + rahna: sikh rahe ho (have been learning)
- Imperfective + jana: bolte jao (go on talking)

**Habitual Construction**
- Perfective + karna: sikha karta tha (used to learn)

### Participle as Adjective
- Perfective participle before noun describes state: sir thame baithi ho (sitting holding your head)
- Imperfective participle for ongoing quality: ane vala (upcoming)

### Time Expressions with Participles
- Duration since action: use Anita ko chore pure char sal ho gaye hain (It's been four years since he left Anita)
- jiske bete ko is ghar me rahte koi ath mahine hue hain (whose son has lived in this house for some eight months)

### Compound Participles
- Multiple verbs working together: sunte sunte tang aa gayi hu (fed up listening)
- Action + state: bana baithi ho (have gone and formed)

### Advanced Causatives
- Double causative patterns: sikhvana (to have taught), banvana (to have built), kahilvana (to have someone tell)
- Examples from dialogue: taxi ko vapas bulvaya ja sakta hai (the taxi can be called back)

### Expressing Determination
- tulna + par: shadi karne par tuli hui hain (bent on getting married)
- Pattern shows strong resolve or fixation

### Expressing Recognition/Revelation
- zahir hai ki... (It's obvious that...)
- ab bat samajh me aa rahi hai (Now things are beginning to make sense)
