## The Duration Challenge

This week, pay attention to:

**During 40-min session:**
- Did you fill the time or run out of exercises?
- Did you rest too long between sets?
- Did it feel rushed or comfortable?

**Goal:** By Week 8, 45-50 min should feel natural.

## If You Miss a Session

You're close to 200. Keep the momentum.

**If you can only do 3 sessions:**
- Upper Push + Bollywood + one of (Lower or Mid+Cardio)

**If you skip Lower again:**
- Notice the pattern. Consider: is Lower actually important to you?
- If not, swap it for swim or another Upper session next week
