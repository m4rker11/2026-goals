# Week 1: Definition + Belief

**Focus:** Track A (Definition)
**One behavior:** Lock in specific start/end times and gather evidence that rest helps work
**Success metric:** Can state exact times. Have 3+ pieces of personal evidence.

---

## The Principle

You can't defend boundaries you haven't defined. And you won't defend boundaries you don't believe in.

Right now your times are "rough" and "easily overridden." That's not a schedule - that's a suggestion to yourself that you ignore. This week we make them real.

But definition alone isn't enough. You said stopping feels good "theoretically" - that means you intellectually know it but don't *feel* it. Without genuine belief, every boundary will feel like sacrifice. You'll white-knuckle it until you burn out.

This week is about both: **define the container** and **gather evidence that the container helps**.

---

## The Behavior

### Part 1: Define Your Times

Answer these right now:

- **Start time:** __________ (be specific: 9:00 AM, not "around 9")
- **End time:** __________ (be specific: 6:00 PM, not "when I'm done")

Write them down. Put them somewhere visible (sticky note, phone wallpaper, calendar event).

These aren't aspirational. These are your defaults. You can have exceptions, but exceptions are announced, not silent.

### Part 2: Gather Evidence

Your brain doesn't believe stopping helps. Let's prove it wrong.

Each day this week, notice ONE of these:
- Did you solve a problem faster after stepping away?
- Did quality drop in the last hour of a long session?
- Did an idea come to you during a break or after stopping?
- Did Anuska seem happier when you were present vs. half-present?
- Did you feel better the morning after stopping on time?

Write it down. Even small observations count.

## Daily Practice

### Morning

1. Look at your defined times (sticky note, calendar, wherever)
2. Say them out loud: "Today I start at [X] and end at [Y]"

### Throughout Day

Notice any evidence that rest/breaks help your work. Mental note or jot it down.

### Evening

- Did you work past your end time? (just notice, no judgment yet)
- Any evidence gathered today?

## Evidence Log

| Day | Evidence observed |
|-----|-------------------|
| Mon | |
| Tue | |
| Wed | |
| Thu | |
| Fri | |
| Sat | |
| Sun | |

Examples of evidence:
- "Stuck on bug for 2 hours, solved it in 5 min after lunch"
- "Last hour of coding had more typos and mistakes"
- "Anuska commented that it was nice to have dinner together"
- "Woke up with solution to yesterday's problem"
- "Felt less burned out this morning after stopping at 6 yesterday"

---

## Why This Matters

You said: "I LOVE coding so it's hard to step away and my ADHD allows me to borderline hyperfocus on it."

Hyperfocus feels productive. But:
- Hyperfocus without breaks leads to diminishing returns
- Hyperfocus that damages relationships isn't sustainable
- Hyperfocus you can't exit is a liability, not an asset

The goal isn't to stop loving coding. It's to work *with* hyperfocus in a container, not be controlled by it.

**Identity shift:** "I'm someone who does intense focused sprints, then stops" vs. "I'm someone who just keeps going until I crash."

## If You Work Past End Time

This week, you're not trying to stop on time yet. You're just *noticing* and *defining*.

If you work late:
1. Notice what time you actually stopped
2. Notice what kept you going (urgent? hyperfocus? "just one more thing"?)
3. No judgment - this is data collection

---

## End of Week Reflection

1. **My defined times are:** Start _______ End _______

2. **Do these times still feel right?** Or do they need adjustment?

3. **Evidence gathered this week:**
   - 1.
   - 2.
   - 3.

4. **Belief shift:** Do I believe stopping on time helps my work more than I did at the start of the week? (1-10 scale)

5. **What I noticed about my patterns:**

---

## Level Progress

| Track | Start of Week | End of Week |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| A: Definition | A2 | A3-A4 |

**A2:** Rough times, easily overridden
**A3:** Specific times exist, written down
**A4:** Times on calendar, visible to self

This week moves you from "rough idea" to "specific and written."

---

## Connection to Goal

This is the foundation. You can't communicate times you haven't defined. You can't execute on times you don't believe in.

```
Week 1: Definition + Belief (you are here)
   ↓
Week 2: Communicate to Anuska
   ↓
Week 3: Hit start time
   ↓
Week 4: Hit stop time + breaks
```

Next week, you'll tell Anuska these times every morning. This week, just get clear with yourself.
