# Unit 15: Habitual Aspect and Postposition se

## Key Concepts

### Habitual Aspect (Perfective Participle + karna)
- Indicates regular/repeated actions in past, present, or future
- Intransitive verbs: hua karta (used to be), jaya karta (used to go)
- Example: mai tin sal se sikh raha hu. Shuru me mai ek evening class me sikha karta tha
- Works across tenses: mai tumhe har hafte patra likha karunga (I will write you weekly)

### Continuous Actions (Imperfective + rahna/jana)
- **rahna** = keep doing (maintain state): padhai karti rahna (keep studying)
- **jana** = go on doing (progressive): bolte jao (go on talking)

### se Revisited - Multiple Meanings
1. **From** (origin): mai Dilli se aa rahi hu
2. **By** (means): mai train se aungi
3. **With** (instrument): maine apne paise se tikat kharida
4. **Than** (comparison): Rajdhani dusri gariyoon se mahangi hai
5. **Because of** (cause): yatri thand se kampne lage
