# Week 4: Daily Activities on Calendar

**Focus:** Track A (Input) - expanding what goes on
**One behavior:** Put gym, food duty, personal blocks on calendar
**Success metric:** Calendar shows your REAL day, not just meetings

---

## The Principle

Right now your calendar has meetings. That's not your day - that's interruptions to your day.

A B2-level calendar shows the full picture: work blocks, gym, meals, personal time. When you look at it, you see YOUR life, not just obligations.

---

## The Shift

### Before (Meetings-Only Calendar)
```

3:00  Hindi tutor

5:00  [empty]
```

```

## What to Add This Week

### Must Add (Daily)
- [ ] **Gym/workout blocks** - When are you exercising?
- [ ] **Dinner** - Who's handling it? What time?
- [ ] **Work start time** - When does focused work begin?
- [ ] **Work end time** - When do you stop? (Work boundaries goal!)

### Should Add (Most Days)
- [ ] **Lunch** - Even just "12-1 Lunch"
- [ ] **Morning routine** - Wake up to work start
- [ ] **Wind down** - When work ends to bedtime structure

### Nice to Add (When Relevant)
- [ ] **Deep work blocks** - Protected focus time
- [ ] **Anuska time** - Intentional together time
- [ ] **Personal errands** - Haircut, groceries, etc.

## Time Blocking Basics

**Don't over-plan.** Start with the big rocks:

| Block Type | Color Suggestion | Examples |
|------------|------------------|----------|
| Work | Blue | Meetings, focus time |
| Health | Green | Gym, PT, walks |
| Personal | Purple | Errands, hobbies |
| Social | Orange | Friends, family |
| Anuska | Pink/Red | Date night, together time |

---

## The Gym Block

Since "200 min zone 2 weekly" is another goal:

- [ ] Decide: Which days are gym days?
- [ ] Add recurring blocks: "Gym" at the time you'll go
- [ ] Start with 2x this week, build to 3x
- [ ] Include travel time if applicable

Example:
```
Mon 6:00-7:30 PM - Gym (Anuska's gym)
Wed 7:00-8:00 AM - Morning run
Sat 10:00-11:30 AM - Gym
```

---

## The Food Duty System

Simple approach:
- [ ] Each evening review (Week 3), decide tomorrow's dinner
- [ ] Add: "Dinner - [who] - [what if known]"
- [ ] Or create a weekly pattern: "Mon/Wed/Fri = Mark, Tue/Thu = Anuska"

---

## Daily Practice

### Morning Check (Week 1 habit)
- Does today's calendar look complete?
- Any blocks missing?

### Throughout Day
- Add activities as you decide them

### Evening Review (Week 3 habit)
- Fill in tomorrow's blocks
- Especially: gym, dinner, work boundaries

---

## Daily Tracking

{% include todo-list.html goal="calendar" unit="week-4" %}

---

## Common Resistance

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "This feels too rigid" | Blocks are intentions, not prisons. Flex as needed. |
| "I don't know when I'll do things" | Put a guess. Adjust tomorrow. |
| "What if plans change?" | Move the block. That's normal. |
| "This takes too long" | 2 min in evening review. Gets faster. |

---

## End of Week Reflection

1. **Coverage:** What % of your real day is on calendar now? ___%

2. **Most useful block added:**

3. **What felt like overkill:**

4. **Gym sessions this week:** ___/planned

5. **Did calendar help with work boundaries?**

---

## Level Progress

| Track | Start of Week | End of Week |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| A: Input | A3-A4 | A4-A5 |
| C: Output | C4-C5 | C5 (maintaining) |

Calendar now shows your life, not just meetings.

---

## Connection to Other Goals

This week directly supports:
- **200 min zone 2:** Gym blocks are scheduled
- **Work boundaries:** Work end time is visible
- **Anuska coordination:** Dinner duty is clear

The calendar is becoming the **keystone habit**.
