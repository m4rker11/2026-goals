# Unit 11: Transitivity and Perfective Tenses

## Key Concepts

### Transitivity
- **Intransitive**: no direct object, describes motion/state change
  - vah aya (he arrived)
  - ham bharat jaenge (we will go to India)
- **Transitive**: takes direct object, action done to something
  - maine pani piya (I drank water)
  - chitthi likho (write a letter)

### Perfective Tenses - Intransitive Verbs
- Verb agrees with subject
- **Present Perfect**: participle + hai/hain
  - kya pitaji laute hain? (has Father returned?)
  - tum ghar pahunche ho (you have reached home)
- **Past Perfect**: participle + tha/the/thi/thin
  - kya koi durghatna hui thi? (had some accident happened?)
  - ham log das baje tak laute the (we had returned by 10)
- Exception: lana (to bring) is transitive but follows intransitive construction

### Perfective Tenses - Transitive Verbs (ne Construction)
- Subject takes ne postposition
- Verb agrees with OBJECT, not subject
- larke ne panch chitthiyan likhin (the boy wrote five letters)
- larke ne ek patr likha (the boy wrote one letter)
- If object takes ko OR no object expressed: verb defaults to masculine singular
  - larkiyon ne chitthi ko parha tha (the girls had read the letter)
  - larki ne dhyan se suna (the girl listened carefully)

### More Perfective Combinations
- Perfective + hoga = will/must have done
  - unhonne faiks bheja hoga (they must have sent a fax)
- Perfective + ho = may have done
  - unhonne faiks bheja ho (they may have sent a fax)
  - mumkin hai ki dadaji na pahunche hon (grandpa may not have arrived)

### Key Agreement Rules Summary
1. Transitive perfective: ne + subject, verb agrees with object
2. Object + ko blocks agreement -> masculine singular verb
3. Intransitive perfective: verb agrees with subject
4. Auxiliary verbs (hai, tha) also agree accordingly

## Vocab Theme
Travel (Nepal, Kathmandu, trekking), shopping (zevar = jewelry, murti = statue, tohfa = gift), photography (camera, photo khichna), borrowing money (udhar lena), apologizing (mafi mangna)

## Dialogue Context
- 11a: Pratap rejoins Hindi class after Nepal trip - conversation with Sharma ji about absence, speaking Hindi there
- 11b: What Pratap bought in Nepal - Tibetan jewelry, silver statues, sold camera due to father borrowing money
- 11c: Pratap phones mother Anita - she worried about his studies, he fell behind several lessons

## Exercises
- Translation with various perfective auxiliary forms (hai, tha, hoga, ho)
- Converting between with/without ko constructions
- Observing agreement changes when ko is added/removed
- Translating sentences about trips, purchases, past events
