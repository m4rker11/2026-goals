# Work Boundaries: 4-Week Program

## The Goal

Transform work schedule from "fluid based on what's happening" to "predictable container that Anuska can rely on" - with predetermined start/end times, mid-day breaks, and at most one announced 15-minute follow-up when truly needed.

## Current State (January 2026)

| Track | Current Level | Target (4 weeks) |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| **A: Definition** (are times firm?) | A2 | A5-A6 |
| **B: Communication** (does Anuska know?) | B1-B2 | B5-B6 |
| **C: Start Execution** (do you hit start?) | C2 | C5-C6 |
| **D: Stop/Breaks Execution** (do you stop, take breaks?) | D1-D2 | D5-D6 |

## The 4 Tracks

### Track A: Definition (Are Times Firm?)

| Level | What It Looks Like |
|-------|-------------------|
| A1 | No set times. Work happens when it happens. |
| A2 | Rough times in head, easily overridden by what's happening. |
| A3 | Specific times exist. Written down somewhere. |
| A4 | Times on calendar, visible to self. |
| A5 | Times shared with Anuska. She knows today's schedule. |
| A6 | Times are contracts. Rarely broken. When broken, it's announced. |

### Track B: Communication (Does Anuska Know?)

| Level | What It Looks Like |
|-------|-------------------|
| B1 | Anuska doesn't know your work schedule. |
| B2 | Anuska knows vaguely ("I'm working today"). |
| B3 | Tell Anuska start/end when she asks. |
| B4 | Announce schedule each morning without being asked. |
| B5 | Announce *before* working late, not after. ("I need 15 more for X") |
| B6 | Anuska can rely on schedule. Exceptions are rare and always announced. |

### Track C: Start Execution (Do You Hit Start Time?)

| Level | What It Looks Like |
|-------|-------------------|
| C1 | Start whenever. No target time. |
| C2 | Have a target in mind, miss it often. |
| C3 | Hit start time 3-4 days per week. |
| C4 | Hit start time 5+ days per week. |
| C5 | Start time is automatic. Doesn't require willpower. |
| C6 | Morning routine flows naturally into work start. |

### Track D: Stop/Breaks Execution (Do You Actually Stop?)

| Level | What It Looks Like |
|-------|-------------------|
| D1 | Stop when exhausted or forced to. No breaks during work. |
| D2 | Stop at "good stopping point" (often 1-2 hours late). |
| D3 | Notice end time. Sometimes stop. Occasional break. |
| D4 | Stop within 30 min of end time most days. 1+ break/day. |
| D5 | Stop on time. One announced 15-min exception allowed when truly needed. Breaks happen. |
| D6 | Stopping is automatic. Work expands/contracts to fit the container. |

## The Underlying Challenge

You love coding + ADHD hyperfocus = boundaries feel like fighting yourself. The startup reality means there's always more to do. And the internal "constantly behind" narrative makes stopping feel irresponsible - even though your output is actually good.

**Key insight from diagnostic:** You don't fully believe stopping is *good for your work* (#10 = "lol theoretically"). Without that belief, every tactic will feel like sacrifice.

**The ADHD factor:** Meds help ~1/3 of days with mid-task pausing. Need strategies for the other 2/3.

## Program Structure

| Week | Focus | Key Behavior | Success Metric |
|------|-------|--------------|----------------|
| **1** | Definition + Belief | Lock in specific times. Internalize why boundaries help. | Can state exact start/end times. Have 3+ pieces of evidence that rest helps work. |
| **2** | Communication | Morning announce to Anuska. Practice the "15 more" protocol. | 5/7 days announce schedule. At least one "15 more" practice. |
| **3** | Start Time | Hit start time consistently. | 5/7 days start within 15 min of target. |
| **4** | Stop + Breaks | Actually stop. Take mid-day breaks. | Stop within 30 min of end time 5/7 days. 4+ breaks during week. |

## Weekly Check-in Template

1. **Compliance:** How many days did I do the target behavior? ___/7
2. **Friction:** What made it hard?
3. **Wins:** What worked well?
4. **Adjustments:** What to tweak for next week?
5. **Level check:** Where am I on each track now?

## Connection to Other Goals

```
Work Boundaries
      │
      ├──► Calendar Mastery (times on calendar = Track A)
      │
      ├──► 200 min Zone 2 (gym happens when work ends on time)
      │
      ├──► Anuska relationship (reliability + presence)
      │
      └──► Spend Less (impulse control pattern)
```

Work Boundaries is enabled BY Calendar Mastery (Week 4 = work end time on calendar) and ENABLES fitness, relationship quality, and general impulse control.

## Diagnostic Summary

From initial assessment:

| # | Scenario | Result |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1 | I have a specific start time I could tell someone right now | Shaky |
| 2 | I have a specific end time I could tell someone right now | Yes (but easily override) |
| 3 | Yesterday, I started work within 15 min of intended time | No |
| 4 | Yesterday, I stopped work within 15 min of intended time | No |
| 5 | When deep in a problem at end time, I can pause mid-task | Almost never (unless meds) |
| 6 | I take at least one non-lunch break for cooking/Anuska | No |
| 7 | Anuska knows my work schedule for today | Shaky |
| 8 | When I need to work late, I tell Anuska *before* continuing | No (guilt blocks this) |
| 9 | I can distinguish "urgent" from "I just want to finish this" | Shaky |
| 10 | I believe stopping on time is *good* for my work | "lol theoretically" |

**Gaps clustered:**
- Belief gap (#10) - foundational
- Definition gap (#1, #2) - times not firm
- Communication gap (#7, #8) - guilt blocks announcing
- Execution gap (#3-6, #9) - not hitting times or taking breaks
