# Week 0: Infrastructure Day

**Time commitment:** 1-2 hours (one-time)
**When to do this:** Before Week 1 starts
**Goal:** Set up all automation so the system works FOR you

---

## Progress

{% include todo-list.html goal="calendar" unit="week-0" %}

---

## Infrastructure Levels Achieved

After completing this day:

| Track | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| D: Infrastructure | D1 | D4-D5 |

You've gone from "calendar exists" to "calendar is everywhere and reminds you automatically."

---

## What's Next

Week 1 focuses on ONE behavior: **Morning calendar check**.

All this infrastructure makes that check effortless - you'll see the calendar whether you try to or not.
