# Chapter 1: Foundations of Case & The "Oblique" Engine

> **Why this matters:** You cannot form complex sentences without mastering the *Oblique Case* (changing word endings).

---

## 1A. The Masculine Oblique Shift

### 1A-i. The "-a" to "-e" Transformation

Masculine nouns ending in **-a** change to **-e** when followed by a postposition.

> **Example:** "Larka" (Boy) -> "Larke ko" (To the boy)

*Difference:* Beginners say "Larka ko" (Incorrect). B2 requires the shift.

---

### 1A-ii. The Stable Masculine

Masculine nouns *not* ending in **-a** do not change in singular oblique.

> **Example:** "Ghar" (House) -> "Ghar mein" (In the house)

*Difference:* Unlike 1A-i, there is no sound change here, often confusing learners.

---

### 1A-iii. The Plural Oblique (The "-on" Rule)

All plural nouns in oblique take **-on**.

> **Example:** "Ladkon ko" (To the boys); "Gharon mein" (In the houses)

*Difference:* This applies even if the noun doesn't change in the nominative plural (e.g., Ghar -> Gharon).

---

## 1B. Feminine Nuances

### 1B-i. Singular Stability

Feminine nouns *never* change in the singular oblique.

> **Example:** "Ladki" (Girl) -> "Ladki ko" (To the girl)

*Difference:* Unlike Masculine -a nouns, Feminine -i nouns are stable.

---

### 1B-ii. The Plural Shift

Feminine plurals change ending to **-on** in oblique.

> **Example:** "Ladkiyan" (Girls) -> "Ladkiyon ko"

*Difference:* Distinction between Subject "Ladkiyan" and Object "Ladkiyon".

---

### 1B-iii. Exception Handling

Words like "Mata" (Mother) generally don't shift like "Larka".

> **Example:** "Mata ji ko" (Not Mate ji)

*Difference:* Honorifics and certain Sanskrit words resist the standard oblique drift.

---

## 1C. The Pronoun Oblique

### 1C-i. The "Ko" Transformation

Pronouns change form entirely with "Ko".

> **Example:** "Main" -> "Mujhe" (not Mujhko); "Vo" -> "Usay" (not Usko)

*Difference:* "Mujhko" is grammatically okay but sounds childish/poetic; "Mujhe" is the B2 standard.

---

### 1C-ii. The "Se/Mein/Par" Base

Using the oblique stem.

> **Example:** "Mujh se" (From me); "Us par" (On him)

*Difference:* You must know the stem "Mujh/Us/Is" separate from the nominative "Main/Vo/Yeh".

---

### 1C-iii. The "K" Possession Block

Possessive pronouns behave like Adjectives.

> **Example:** "Mere ghar mein" (In my house)

*Difference:* "Mera" changes to "Mere" because "Ghar" is in the oblique case (due to 'mein').
