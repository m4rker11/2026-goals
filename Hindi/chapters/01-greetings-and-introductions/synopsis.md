# Unit 1: Greetings and Introductions

## Key Concepts
- **Personal pronouns and verb 'to be'**: Three levels of 'you' - tu (intimate), tum (informal), aap (formal/respectful)
- **Pronoun forms**: main + hoon, tum + ho, aap/ve + hain, vah + hai
- **Third person distance**: yah/ye (near) vs vah/ve (remote)
- **Question formation**: Add kya at start or use rising intonation
- **Noun gender**: All nouns are masculine or feminine - must learn with each word
- **Noun plurals**:
  - Masc type 1 (-aa ending) -> -e plural (ladka -> ladke)
  - Masc type 2 (other endings) -> no change (makaan stays makaan)
  - Fem type 1 (-ii/-i/-iya) -> -iyaan plural (ladki -> ladkiyaan)
  - Fem type 2 (other) -> add -en (mez -> mezen)
- **Adjectives**:
  - Inflecting (-aa ending): -aa (m.sg), -e (m.pl), -ii (f.sg/pl)
  - Invariable (other endings): no change (laal, saaf, sundar)
- **Word order**: Subject...Verb at end. Nahiin precedes verb for negation.
