# Phase 2: Know Your Triggers (Week 4-6)

**Dates:** Jan 26 - Feb 15
**Focus:** Understand when/where/why impulse hits

---

## The Principle

You can't fix what you don't see. This phase is about observation, not perfection.

## Phase Tasks

## The Impulse Log

Every time you feel the urge to buy something (whether you buy it or not), log it:

| Date | Item | Price | Where | Trigger | Bought? | 24hr later feeling |
|------|------|-------|-------|---------|---------|-------------------|
| | | | | | | |
| | | | | | | |
| | | | | | | |
| | | | | | | |
| | | | | | | |
| | | | | | | |
| | | | | | | |
| | | | | | | |

**Trigger examples:** Bored, stressed, saw YouTube video, email deal, browsing

---

## YouTube Audit

List channels that trigger buying urges:

| Channel | What They Sell You On | Action |
|---------|----------------------|--------|
| | | Unfollow / Mute / Keep |
| | | Unfollow / Mute / Keep |
| | | Unfollow / Mute / Keep |

**Goal:** Reduce exposure, not willpower through it.
