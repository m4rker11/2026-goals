# Chapter 4: Adjectives, Comparisons & The "Sa" Particle

> Describing the world with nuance.

---

## 4A. Agreement Rules

### 4A-i. Marked Adjectives (-a ending)

Change with gender/number/case.

> **Example:** "Achha ladka" -> "Achhe ladke" (Plural/Oblique)

*Difference:* You must match the adjective to the noun's final state (including oblique).

---

### 4A-ii. Unmarked Adjectives

Do not change form.

> **Example:** "Sundar ladka" / "Sundar ladki"

*Difference:* You cannot say "Sundari ladki". Words like *Sundar*, *Dilchasp*, *Saaf* are immutable.

---

### 4A-iii. Mixed Adjective Strings

Handling multiple descriptors.

> **Example:** "Ek lamba, sundar, aur tez ladka."

*Difference:* Only "lamba" changes (lambe ladke ko); "sundar" and "tez" stay rigid.

---

## 4B. Comparisons (The "Se" Method)

### 4B-i. Comparative (Se Zyada)

"More X than Y"

> **Example:** "Chai coffee se behtar hai" (Tea is better than coffee)

*Difference:* Hindi uses the postposition "from" (Se) to denote comparison.

---

### 4B-ii. Superlative (Sabse)

"More than all"

> **Example:** "Yeh sabse achha hai" (This is the best of all)

*Difference:* No separate word for "-est" (biggest/best); just "from all" (Sab-se).

---

### 4B-iii. Implicit Comparison

Dropping the object.

> **Example:** "Aur bada dikhao" (Show a bigger one)

*Difference:* "Aur" here means "more", implying comparison without "Se".

---

## 4C. The "Sa/Si/Se" Particle

### 4C-i. Similarity (Like-ish)

Resemblance.

> **Example:** "Chand sa chehra" (Moon-like face)

*Difference:* Adds poetic or descriptive comparison.

---

### 4C-ii. Diminutive (A little bit)

Softening adjectives.

> **Example:** "Thoda sa paani" (A little bit of water)

*Difference:* "Thoda paani" is factual; "Thoda sa" is a specific/measured quantity.

---

### 4C-iii. Vagueness

> **Example:** "Koi sa bhi" (Any one / Whichever)

*Difference:* Adds indefinite quality to the selection.
