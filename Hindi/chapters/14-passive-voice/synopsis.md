# Unit 14: Passive Voice and More Relative Clauses

## Key Concepts

### Passive Voice
- Agent marked with **se** (common) or **ke dvara** (formal)
- Example: yah kam kisi aur se kiya jae (This work should be done by someone else)
- Taj Mahal Shahjahan ke dvara banaya gaya tha

### Intransitive Passive (suggestions)
- For suggesting group actions: baitha jae? (Shall we sit?)
- Note: jana becomes **jaya** in passive: bazar jaya jae? (Shall we go to the market?)
- cala jae? (Shall we be off?)

### Passive of Inability
- Pattern: Agent + se + Passive + nahi
- Expresses physical/emotional inability: yah khana mujhse khaya nahi jata (I can't bear to eat this food)
- mujhse na raha gaya (I couldn't contain myself)

### Transitive vs Intransitive Pairs
- Hindi often has separate verbs where English uses one
- Intransitive (state): botal tutthi hai (The bottle breaks)
- Transitive (agent): vah botal ko torhta hai (He breaks the bottle)
- Active intransitive can express passive meaning: yah kapra Jaipur me banta hai (This cloth is made in Jaipur)

### To Begin To
- Spontaneous: Oblique infinitive + lagna: barish hone lagi (It began to rain)
- Deliberate: Direct infinitive + shuru karna: maine likhna shuru kiya (I took up writing)
- Note: lagna does not take ne in perfective

### To Allow (Oblique Infinitive + dena)
- chachaji ne mujhe apni gari chalane di (Uncle let me drive his car)
- billi ko makkhan na khane dena (Don't let the cat eat the butter)
- rahne do! (Let it be!)
