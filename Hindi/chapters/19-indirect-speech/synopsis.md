# Chapter 19: Indirect Speech

**Why this matters:** You need this to report conversations before you learn to build complex "If" scenarios.

## 19A. The Tense Freeze

### 19A-i. No Backshifting

Unlike English, Hindi **does not backshift** tenses in indirect speech. The tense remains exactly as it was spoken.

> **English:** "He said he **was** going."
> **Hindi:** "Usne kaha ki main ja raha **hoon**."
> *(He said that I **am** going.)*

**Key Difference:** Keeping the tense exactly as it was spoken is the **#1 rule** of Hindi indirect speech.

---

### 19A-ii. Pronoun Shifts

While tenses stay frozen, **pronouns must change** appropriately.

> **Direct:** Ram said, "I am busy."
> **Indirect:** "Ram ne kaha ki vo busy hai."
> *(Ram said that he is busy.)*

The pronoun shifts from "I" (main) to "he" (vo), but the tense remains present.

---

### 19A-iii. Time Word Stability

**Time words** also remain unchanged in Hindi indirect speech.

> **Example:** "He said he will come tomorrow."
> "Usne kaha ki vo kal aayega."

**Key Difference:** English might change "tomorrow" to "the next day," but Hindi keeps it as *kal*.

---

## 19B. The "Ki" Connector

### 19B-i. "That" is Mandatory

Unlike English where "that" can be dropped, **"ki" is rarely omitted** in Hindi.

> **Example:** "Mujhe laga ki..."
> *(I felt that...)*

---

### 19B-ii. "Ki" for Thoughts

*Ki* is used after verbs of thinking, believing, and knowing.

> **Example:** "Maine socha ki..."
> *(I thought that...)*

---

### 19B-iii. Naming Things

*Ki* is also used when defining or explaining something.

> **Example:** "Iska matlab hai ki..."
> *(This means that...)*

---

## 19C. Indirect Commands

### 19C-i. Imperative Becomes Subjunctive/Chahiye

When reporting commands, the imperative can become subjunctive or use *chahiye*.

> **Direct:** Mom said, "Eat food."
>
> **Indirect Options:**
> - "Maa ne kaha ki khana khao." *(Direct quote style)*
> - "Maa ne kaha ki main khana khaoon." *(Subjunctive - true indirect)*

---

### 19C-ii. Reporting Requests

Requests can be reported using the **infinitive construction**.

> **Example:** "Usne mujhe jane ke liye kaha."
> *(He told me to go.)*
