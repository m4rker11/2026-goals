# Unit 4: Past Tense - Was/Were

## Key Concepts
- **Past tense of 'to be' (honaa)**: Unlike present, distinguishes gender AND number
  - thaa (m.sg), thii (f.sg), the (m.pl), thiin (f.pl - nasalized)
  - "main kal daftar men thaa" = I was in the office yesterday
  - "maan ghar par nahiin thiin" = Mother wasn't at home
- **to (so/as for)**: Two uses
  - At start of phrase = "so/then" (to kya dukaan band hai?)
  - After word = contrast/emphasis (khaana to garam thaa = the food WAS hot [but...])
- **Comparisons with se**:
  - X + Y se + adjective = X is more [adj] than Y
  - "Sangeeta Raj se lambii hai" = Sangeeta is taller than Raj
  - Add zyaada (more) or kam (less) for emphasis
  - Superlative: sab se + adjective = most/best of all
- **ko constructions** (experiencer as indirect object):
  - State/sensation is grammatical subject, person marked with ko
  - "daadii ji ko zukaam thaa" = Granny had a cold (lit: to Granny cold was)
  - Verb agrees with state noun, not person
  - Same pattern: maalum (known), pasand (pleasing/liked)
  - "mujh ko maalum hai" = I know (lit: to me it is known)
- **Vocative case**: For addressing someone
  - Singular = same as oblique (bete!)
  - Plural = -o NOT nasalized (bacco! vs oblique baccoon)

## Vocab Theme
Health (zukaam, bukhaar, biiimar, golii), time/place (kal=yesterday/tomorrow, daftar, dukaan, baahar), relationships (dost, rishtedaar, mitr), emotions (pyaara, khushi, afsos), comparison words (zyaada, kam, sabse)

## Dialogue Context
- 4a: Pinky asks Sangeeta about missing class and her "friend" Suhas - past locations and comparisons
- 4b: Khanna ji at office asks about absent workers - illness, past tense, ko constructions
