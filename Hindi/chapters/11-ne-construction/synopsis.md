# Chapter 11: The "Ne" Construction (Ergative Case)

**The biggest hurdle for learners.**

---

## 11A. The Core Logic

### 11A-i. Transitive Only

The **Ne** construction is used *only* with transitive verbs in perfective tenses.

> **Example:**
> "Maine chai pee" (Transitive) vs "Main soya" (Intransitive)

**Key Difference:** Intransitive verbs never take "Ne" - the subject remains in the nominative case.

---

### 11A-ii. Perfective Tenses Only

**Ne** appears only in perfective aspects (simple past, present perfect, past perfect).

> **Example:**
> "Maine khaya" (Simple Past)
> "Maine khaya hai" (Present Perfect)

**Key Difference:** Never used in Present, Future, or Continuous tenses.

---

### 11A-iii. Object Agreement

When using **Ne**, the verb agrees with the *object*, not the subject.

> **Example:**
> "Ram ne roti khayi" (Ram ate bread)

**Key Difference:** The verb "khayi" matches *Roti* (Feminine), not *Ram* (Masculine).

---

## 11B. Pronoun Shifts

### 11B-i. Main -> Maine

The first person pronoun transforms when taking **Ne**.

> **Main** (I) becomes **Maine** (I + ergative marker)

---

### 11B-ii. Vo -> Usne

Third person pronouns also shift.

> **Vo** (He/She) becomes **Usne**

---

### 11B-iii. Kaun -> Kisne

Even question words change form with the ergative case.

> **Example:**
> "Kisne kiya?" (Who did it?)

**Key Difference:** The question word also changes form - *Kaun* becomes *Kisne*.

---

## 11C. The Exceptions (B2 Level Knowledge)

### 11C-i. Speaking/Understanding

Some verbs of communication allow flexibility.

> **Example:**
> "Main bola" (I spoke) *OR* "Maine bola"

**Key Difference:** *Bolna* allows both constructions, but "Maine kaha" (said) *always* requires Ne.

---

### 11C-ii. The "Lana" (Bring) Exception

The verb "to bring" behaves unexpectedly.

> **Example:**
> "Main pani laya" (Not "Maine")

**Key Difference:** *Lana* is functionally transitive but grammatically intransitive - it implies "to come with" something.

---

### 11C-iii. Compound Interference

The auxiliary verb in compound constructions determines whether **Ne** is needed.

> **Example:**
> "Main kha chuka" (I have eaten - *no Ne*)
> vs
> "Maine kha liya" (I ate - *Ne required*)

**Key Difference:** The auxiliary vector determines the Ne requirement. *Chukna* is intransitive; *Lena* is transitive.
