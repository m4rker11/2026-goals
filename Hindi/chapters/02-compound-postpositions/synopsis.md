# Chapter 2: Compound Postpositions

> **Why this matters:** Chapter 1 teaches basic cases. This chapter applies them to complex locations and abstract ideas.

---

## 2A. Spatial Relationships (The "Ke" Builders)

### 2A-i. Front/Back/Below

**"Ke aage"** (Ahead), **"Ke piche"** (Behind), **"Ke niche"** (Below)

> **Example:** "Mere ghar ke piche park hai."

*Difference:* These require the masculine oblique marker "Ke", not "Ki".

---

### 2A-ii. Facing/Opposite

**"Ke samne"** (In front of/Facing)

> **Example:** "Dukan ke samne" (Opposite the shop)

*Difference:* Distinct from "Ke aage" (Ahead of - in a line).

---

### 2A-iii. The "Ki" Exceptions

Directions often take **"Ki"**.

> **Example:** "Shahar ki taraf" (Towards the city); "Ki or" (Towards)

*Difference:* Most compound postpositions are "Ke", but direction/manner words are often "Ki".

---

## 2B. Abstract Connectors

### 2B-i. Cause & Effect

**"Ke karan"** / **"Ki wajah se"** (Because of)

> **Example:** "Barish ki wajah se" (Due to rain)

*Difference:* Note that "Wajah" is feminine (Ki), but "Karan" is masculine (Ke).

---

### 2B-ii. Inclusion/Exclusion

**"Ke alava"** (Apart from) / **"Ke bina"** (Without)

> **Example:** "Tumhare bina" (Without you)

---

### 2B-iii. Contrast

**"Ke bawajood"** (In spite of)

> **Example:** "Mehnat ke bawajood, vo fail ho gaya."

---

## 2C. Possession Logic

### 2C-i. Gender Agreement

The **"Ka/Ke/Ki"** agrees with the *possessed object*, not the owner.

> **Example:** "Ram ki gadi" (Ram's car - Gadi is F)

*Difference:* English speakers often try to match Ram (M).

---

### 2C-ii. Double Oblique

> **Example:** "Mere bhai ke dost ke ghar mein"

*Difference:* Chaining possessions puts every link in the chain into the oblique case.

---

### 2C-iii. "Ke paas" (Ownership vs Proximity)

> **Example:** "Mere paas paise hain" (I have money) vs "Mere paas aao" (Come near me)
