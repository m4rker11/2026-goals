# Week 2: Seattle Movement

**Focus:** Add variety while still traveling
**One behavior:** 2 gym sessions + 1 cardio + PT stretches
**Success metric:** 90+ minutes total

## The Principle

You proved you can work out in Seattle. Now add **variety**.

A jog or walk explores the area AND builds cardio. Two birds.

## If You Miss a Session

Still in travel mode. Flexibility matters.

**If you miss Lower:**
- It's okay. You historically skip legs. Don't shame yourself.
- Just do Upper + Cardio + PT = still ~75 min (solid)

**If weather kills the jog:**
- Do a 15-min cardio circuit inside (jumping jacks, high knees, burpees)
- Or skip it and add 5 min to another session
