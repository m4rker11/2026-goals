# Unit 3: Postpositions Basics

## Key Concepts
- **Postpositions follow nouns** (unlike English prepositions): "makaan men" = in the house
- **Key postpositions**: men (in), par (on), se (from/since), tak (until/as far as), ko (to)
- **Direct vs Oblique case**:
  - Direct case: noun as subject of verb
  - Oblique case: noun followed by postposition
- **Oblique case changes**:
  - Masc type 1 (-aa): singular -aa -> -e (kamra -> kamre men)
  - Masc type 2: no change in singular (ghar men)
  - ALL nouns plural oblique: end in -on (kamron men, gharon men)
- **Adjectives in oblique**:
  - Masc -aa adjectives -> -e (bada kamra -> bade kamre men)
  - Feminine adjectives (-ii) don't change
  - Invariable adjectives don't change
- **Pronoun oblique forms**:
  - yah -> is (this), ye -> in (these)
  - vah -> us (that), ve -> un (those)
  - main -> mujh, tum -> tum (same), aap -> aap (same)
- **Possessive pronouns act like adjectives**: mera/mere/meri, tumhara/tumhare/tumhari, apka/apke/apki
