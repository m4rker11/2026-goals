# Week 2: Communication Protocol

**Focus:** Track B (Communication)
**One behavior:** Announce your schedule to Anuska each morning. Practice the "15 more" protocol.
**Success metric:** 5/7 days announce schedule. At least one "15 more" practice (even manufactured).

---

## The Principle

You said you don't tell Anuska before working late because you "feel guilty about it."

Here's the problem: hiding makes it worse. She doesn't know what to expect, so she can't plan around you. And you feel guilty anyway - plus now you're hiding.

Announcing isn't asking permission. It's giving information so she can rely on you.

**The shift:** From "I hope she doesn't notice I'm still working" to "I'm working until 6, then I'm yours."

---

## The Behavior

### Morning Announce

Each morning, tell Anuska:

> "Today I'm working [start time] to [end time]."

That's it. No justification. No apology. Just information.

If your schedules vary, add: "I'll have a break around [time] for [lunch/cooking/whatever]."

### The "15 More" Protocol

When you need to work past your end time:

1. **Stop** at end time (even mid-keystroke)
2. **Go to Anuska** (physically, not a text from your desk)
3. **Say:** "I need about 15 more minutes to [specific thing]. I'll be done by [specific time]."
4. **Actually stop** at that time

This is different from silently continuing. It's:
- Announced (she knows)
- Bounded (15 min, not "a bit more")
- Specific (she knows what for)

---

## The Guilt Reframe

You feel guilty asking for more time. But consider:

**Silent overtime:** Anuska doesn't know when you'll be done. She can't plan. She waits. She gets frustrated. You feel guilty AND she's frustrated.

**Announced overtime:** Anuska knows you need 15 more minutes. She plans around it. You stop when you said. She knows what to expect. Less frustration. Less guilt.

Which actually respects her more?

## Daily Practice

### Morning

Before starting work:
- [ ] Tell Anuska your start and end time for today
- [ ] Mention any mid-day breaks planned

### End of Day

If you need more time:
- [ ] Stop at end time
- [ ] Go to Anuska, announce the extension
- [ ] Give specific time and reason
- [ ] Actually stop at the stated time

If you don't need more time:
- [ ] Just stop. Notice how it feels.

---

## Practice the Protocol

**Important:** Practice "15 more" at least once this week, even if you don't need it.

On one day, at your end time, go to Anuska and say: "I'm going to take 15 more minutes to wrap up what I'm working on. I'll be done by [time]."

Then actually do it. This is a practice run for when you really need it.

Why practice? Because when you're hyperfocused and actually need it, you won't have the mental bandwidth to figure out the script. Practice now so it's automatic later.

---

## What If She Asks Questions?

She might ask: "Why are you telling me this?"

Answer honestly: "I'm working on having clearer boundaries so you know what to expect. Is this helpful?"

She might also help enforce: "Can you let me know if I forget to tell you in the morning?"

## If You Forget to Announce

If you realize mid-day you didn't announce:
1. Tell her now: "I forgot to say - I'm working until [time] today."
2. Note what got in the way (rushed morning? awkward to bring up?)
3. Tomorrow, set a reminder or tie it to a trigger (after coffee, before opening laptop)

---

## If You Work Late Without Announcing

This will happen. When it does:
1. Notice it afterward (don't beat yourself up)
2. Next time, pause at end time even for 10 seconds before continuing
3. That pause is your chance to announce

The goal is to insert a pause. Right now you flow past end time without noticing. The pause is where the announcement can happen.

---

## End of Week Reflection

1. **Morning announce days:** ___/7

2. **Did I practice the "15 more" protocol?** [ ] Yes [ ] No

3. **How did Anuska respond to the announcements?**

4. **What made announcing hard?**
   - [ ] Forgot
   - [ ] Felt awkward
   - [ ] Didn't want to "commit" to a time
   - [ ] Other: _______________

5. **Did announcing make stopping easier or harder?**

## Level Progress

| Track | Start of Week | End of Week |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| A: Definition | A3-A4 | A4-A5 |
| B: Communication | B1-B2 | B4-B5 |

**B4:** Announce schedule each morning without being asked
**B5:** Announce *before* working late, not after

---

## Connection to Goal

Communication is the bridge between definition and execution.

When Anuska knows your schedule:
- You've made a commitment (external accountability)
- She can plan around you (less friction)
- Working late requires a conversation, not just inertia

```
Week 1: Definition + Belief ✓
   ↓
Week 2: Communicate to Anuska (you are here)
   ↓
Week 3: Hit start time
   ↓
Week 4: Hit stop time + breaks
```

Next week: actually hitting start time. But communication makes that easier because now someone else knows the target.
