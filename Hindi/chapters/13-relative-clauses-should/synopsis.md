# Unit 13: Relative Clauses and Obligation

## Key Concepts

### Relative-Correlative Constructions (jab...tab)
- **jab...tab/to** = when...then (basic time clause)
- **jab se...tab se** = since (point in time)
- **jab tak...tab tak** = as long as, by the time that
- **jab tak...na/nahi...tab tak** = until (with negative)
- **jyonhi / jaise hi...tyonhi / vaise hi** = as soon as

Key insight: Relative words start with j-, interrogatives with k-. The j-clause typically comes first.

### Infinitive + chahiye (should/ought)
- Person under compulsion takes **ko**: mujhko jana chahiye
- If direct object lacks ko, infinitive agrees with it: unko hindi sikhni chahiye
- If object takes ko, infinitive stays masculine singular: tumhe is kitab ko parhna chahiye
- Past: add **tha** to indicate what "should have" happened

### Infinitive + hona / parna (have to/must)
- **hona** = mild/planned compulsion: aaj mujhe Dilli jana hai
- **parna** = external/forced necessity: barish ki vajah se hame chata kharidna para
- Agreement: verb agrees with direct object (unless object takes ko)

### jo...vah (the one who)
- jo = (the one) who/which (singular and plural)
- Oblique forms: jis/jisne/jin/jinhonne when followed by postposition
- Indefinite: jo koi (whoever), jo bhi (whatever), jo kuch (whatever amount)

### milna (to be available/get/meet)
- To get: receiver takes ko, item is subject: ma ko tumhara fax mila
- Unplanned meeting: ko (kal ham ko Sita mili)
- Planned meeting: se (kal ham Sita se mile)
- To resemble: milna-julna

### lagna (to seem/strike/be attached)
- Feelings with ko: mujhe pyaas lagi hai (I'm thirsty)
- Opinions: yah shahar mujhe bahut achha lagta hai
- Time/cost: chai banane me panch minat lagte hain
- Relationships: Arun Sangeeta ka chacha lagta hai

## Vocab Theme
Family relationships, studying abroad, language learning, daily activities, feelings and sensations (hunger, thirst, fear, cold/hot)

## Dialogue Context
- **13a**: Pratap practices Hindi with Rishi - discussing Nepal trip, mother's advice, practicing jab-constructions
- **13b**: Dinner party discussion about Hindi/Punjabi languages, regional dialects, family resemblances
