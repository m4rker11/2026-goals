# Week 3: Start Time Execution

**Focus:** Track C (Start Execution)
**One behavior:** Actually start work within 15 minutes of your defined time
**Success metric:** 5/7 days start within 15 min of target

---

## The Principle

Start time is easier than stop time. You're not fighting hyperfocus - you're just fighting morning inertia.

If you can nail start time, you build the muscle of "hitting the target." That same muscle helps with stop time later.

Also: consistent start time gives Anuska predictability. She knows when work-you begins, so she can plan her morning accordingly.

---

## The Behavior

### The Target

Your defined start time from Week 1: __________

"Start work" means: actively working on a work task. Not "sitting at desk checking Twitter." Not "opening laptop and then making coffee."

### The Trigger

What happens right before your start time? That's your trigger.

Examples:
- After morning coffee → start work
- After morning workout → start work
- After Anuska leaves → start work
- After morning announce (Week 2 habit) → start work

Identify YOUR trigger: __________

### The Ritual

Create a tiny start ritual that signals "work is beginning":

Examples:
- Open Linear, look at today's tasks, pick one
- Say out loud: "Work starts now"
- Put on headphones (even if no music)
- Move to your work spot (if different from personal spot)

Your ritual: __________

## Morning Checklist

- Morning announce to Anuska (Week 2)
- Trigger happens
- Start ritual
- Actually working by [target time]

## Common Start Time Killers

| Killer | Solution |
|--------|----------|
| "Just checking one thing" before work | Check AFTER start ritual, not before |
| Morning routine runs long | Set alarm for 15 min before start time |
| Anuska time bleeds into work time | Build in buffer OR accept slightly later start |
| Feel like I should work out first but don't | Decide: morning workout or not. Don't waffle. |
| Don't know what to work on | Pick task the night before (Week 2 evening routine helps) |

## What If You're Early?

Great! Start early if you want. The goal is "by [time]" not "exactly at [time]."

Early is fine. Late is what we're fixing.

---

## What If Something Comes Up?

Life happens. If there's a genuine reason to start late:
1. Announce it to Anuska: "Starting at [new time] today because [reason]"
2. Note it in tracking as "late - excused"
3. Don't use this as a loophole every day

---

## Daily Tracking

{% include todo-list.html goal="work-boundaries" unit="week-3" %}

---

## If You Miss

If you realize you're past your start time:
1. Start NOW (even if it's 30 min late, starting is better than not)
2. Note what happened: overslept? distracted? no trigger?
3. Tomorrow, address that specific friction

Don't spiral. One late start doesn't break the week. 5/7 is the goal, not 7/7.

---

## The ADHD Factor

ADHD can make mornings hard. Some things that help:
- **External accountability:** Tell Anuska you're starting at [time], ask her to check
- **Visual cue:** Calendar notification, alarm, sticky note on laptop
- **Body doubling:** Start time = same time as Anuska starts her thing
- **Lower the bar:** First task of day is easy/engaging, not the hardest thing

What might help you? __________

## Level Progress

| Track | Start of Week | End of Week |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| C: Start | C2 | C3-C4 |

**C2:** Have a target, miss it often
**C3:** Hit start time 3-4 days/week
**C4:** Hit start time 5+ days/week

---

## Connection to Goal

Start time is the warm-up. If you can't hit a target when there's no hyperfocus to fight, you won't hit one when there is.

Building this muscle matters:
- Shows yourself you CAN hit a time
- Builds Anuska's trust in your schedule
- Creates momentum for Week 4 (the hard one)

```
Week 1: Definition + Belief ✓
   ↓
Week 2: Communicate to Anuska ✓
   ↓
Week 3: Hit start time (you are here)
   ↓
Week 4: Hit stop time + breaks
```

Next week: the hard one. Stopping. But you've built the foundation - defined times, Anuska knows them, and you've practiced hitting a target. Now we apply that to the moment of hyperfocus.
