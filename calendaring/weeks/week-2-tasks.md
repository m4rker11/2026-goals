# Week 2: Immediate Input

**Focus:** Track A (Input)
**One behavior:** Add events the MOMENT they're scheduled
**Success metric:** Zero "I'll add it later" - 100% immediate capture

---

## The Principle

From the Reddit thread: "I put the appointment in the instant I make it. I'll stand in the doctor's office checkout area until it's in there."

The ADHD brain has a 30-second window. If it doesn't go in immediately, it's gone.

---

## The Behavior

### Trigger
The moment someone says a time/date for anything:
- Doctor says "Let's schedule your follow-up"
- Friend texts "Want to grab dinner Friday?"
- Work says "Let's meet at 3pm"
- You decide "I'll go to gym tomorrow morning"

### Action
STOP. Add it NOW. Don't move on until it's in.

### Tools (pick your fastest)
- Voice: "Hey Google, add to calendar: [event] at [time]"
- Widget: Tap calendar widget → + → quick add
- Phone: Stand there and type it in

---

## The "Don't Move Until It's In" Rule

| Situation | What You Do |
|-----------|-------------|
| Doctor's office checkout | Stand at counter, add it, THEN leave |
| Phone call scheduling | Stay on call, add it, confirm out loud |
| Text conversation | Reply AFTER you've added it |
| Deciding something yourself | Say it out loud, add it, then proceed |

**The key:** Treat adding to calendar as part of the scheduling action, not a separate step.

## Voice Command Cheat Sheet

Practice these until they're muscle memory:

```
"Hey Google, add to calendar: Dentist Friday at 2pm"
"Hey Google, add event: Dinner with Alex tomorrow 7pm"
"Hey Google, create calendar event: Gym Wednesday 7am"
```

If voice isn't working well, fix it NOW - it's worth the 5 minutes.

## Daily Practice

### Morning (continue from Week 1)
- [ ] Morning calendar check (this is now automatic, right?)

### Throughout Day
Every time something gets scheduled:
- [ ] Add it IMMEDIATELY
- [ ] Include: location, relevant details, who's involved
- [ ] Set appropriate reminders if default isn't enough

### Evening
- [ ] Quick scan: Did anything get scheduled today that's NOT on calendar?
- [ ] If yes, add it now and note why it slipped

## Daily Tracking

{% include todo-list.html goal="calendar" unit="week-2" %}

## Common Failure Modes

| Failure | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| "I'll remember" | You won't. Add it now. |
| "I'm in a conversation" | Pause: "One sec, let me add this" |
| "My phone is in my pocket" | Keep it out during scheduling moments |
| "Voice command didn't work" | Fix the friction - try again or type |
| "I'll add details later" | Add minimal now, details are bonus |

## Level Progress

| Track | Start of Week | End of Week |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| A: Input | A1-A2 | A2-A3 |
| C: Output | C2-C3 | C3 (maintaining) |

---

## Building on Week 1

```
Week 1: Morning check ✓ (keep doing this!)
Week 2: Immediate input (you are here)
   ↓
Week 3: Evening review
```

Morning check should feel automatic now. If not, that's okay - keep practicing both.
