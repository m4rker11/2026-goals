# Week 6: Weekly Planning + Partner Sync

**Focus:** All tracks - integration and sustainability
**Two behaviors:** Sunday/Monday weekly review + shared calendar with Anuska
**Success metric:** Week feels planned, not reactive

---

## The Principle

Daily habits are running. Now we zoom out.

Weekly planning prevents the "I don't know what's happening this week" feeling. Partner sync prevents the "I thought you were handling that" conflict.

---

## Part 1: Weekly Planning Ritual

### When
Pick ONE time. Suggestions:
- Sunday evening (plan the week before it starts)
- Monday morning (first thing, before work)
- Monday during lunch (natural break)

**Your chosen time:** _________________________

### Duration
20-30 minutes the first few times. Gets faster.

## Weekly Review Checklist

```
LOOK BACK (5 min)
□ How did last week go?
□ Any tasks that rolled over?
□ Any calendar blocks I ignored? Why?

LOOK AT THIS WEEK (10 min)
□ What's already scheduled?
□ Any gaps that need filling?
□ Which days are heavy? Light?
□ When is gym happening? (200 min goal)
□ Any deadlines this week?
□ Social plans?
□ Anuska coordination needed?

TASKS (5 min)
□ What must get done this week?
□ Move tasks to specific days in Google Tasks
□ Any tasks need calendar time blocks?

PREP (5 min)
□ Anything to prepare for upcoming events?
□ Any decisions to make now vs later?
□ Is there breathing room or is it overpacked?
```

## Part 2: Anuska Calendar Sync

### Option A: Shared Calendar

- [ ] Create shared Google Calendar: "Mark + Anuska"
- [ ] Both have edit access
- [ ] Use for: dinner plans, social events, travel, joint commitments
- [ ] Personal stuff stays on personal calendars

### Option B: Weekly Sync Conversation

If shared calendar feels like too much:
- [ ] Pick a time: Sunday evening after dinner?
- [ ] 10 min: "What's your week look like?"
- [ ] Identify conflicts, dinner duty, joint plans
- [ ] Add to your calendar

### Option C: Hybrid

- [ ] Shared calendar for big stuff
- [ ] Weekly quick sync for the details

**Your choice:** _________________________

## The Sunday Sync Template

If doing a weekly conversation with Anuska:

```
"Hey, want to do our week check-in?"

1. What's on each of your calendars this week?
2. Any evenings one of us is out?
3. Who's handling dinner which nights?
4. Anything we need to do together?
5. Any conflicts to resolve?

→ Both update calendars after.
```

## Weekly Planning Location

Where will you do the weekly review?
- [ ] Same spot each time (ritual helps)
- [ ] Coffee shop Sunday morning
- [ ] Desk Monday first thing
- [ ] Couch with laptop Sunday evening

**Your spot:** _________________________
