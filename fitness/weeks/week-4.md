# Week 4: Three Gym Sessions

**Focus:** First week with 3 gym sessions
**One behavior:** Complete 3 distinct gym days
**Success metric:** 145+ minutes total

## The Principle

Two gym sessions felt okay. Now we add a third.

This is where the routine starts to form. **Three is a pattern.**

## If You Miss a Session

**Three sessions is new.** If you only hit 2, that's still okay.

Priority order:
1. Upper Push (track pushup progress)
2. Upper Pull (track pullup progress)
3. Mid + Cardio (can skip if needed)

---

## Why Push/Pull Split This Week

Instead of one "Upper" day, we split into Push and Pull:
- More focused work on each movement pattern
- Better for building pushup/pullup numbers
- Sets you up for calisthenics progression
