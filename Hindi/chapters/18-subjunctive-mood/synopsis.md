# Chapter 18: Commands, Requests & Subjunctive Mood

**Focus:** Imperatives, polite requests, and the world of maybe.

---

## 18A. Imperative Mood (Commands)

### 18A-i. The Three Registers

Hindi has three imperative forms matching the Tu/Tum/Aap hierarchy.

| Register | Formation | Example (khaana - to eat) |
|----------|-----------|---------------------------|
| **Tu** (intimate/rude) | Verb stem | Kha! |
| **Tum** (familiar) | Stem + o | Khao! |
| **Aap** (respectful) | Stem + iye/iye | Khaiye! |

> **Examples:**
> - "Baitho!" (Sit! - to friend)
> - "Baithiye!" (Please sit - to elder)
> - "Baith!" (Sit! - to child or rudely)

**Key Difference:** Using Tu form with strangers or elders is deeply offensive.

---

### 18A-ii. Irregular Imperatives

Common verbs have irregular imperative forms.

| Verb | Tu | Tum | Aap |
|------|-----|------|------|
| **Karna** (do) | Kar | Karo | Kijiye |
| **Lena** (take) | Le | Lo | Lijiye |
| **Dena** (give) | De | Do | Dijiye |
| **Peena** (drink) | Pee | Piyo | Pijiye |
| **Hona** (be) | Ho | Ho | Hoiye |

> **Example:** "Ye lo" (Take this) vs "Ye lijiye" (Please take this)

---

### 18A-iii. Negative Commands

Negation uses **mat** (not **nahi**).

> **Examples:**
> - "Mat jao!" (Don't go!)
> - "Mat karo!" (Don't do it!)
> - "Mat boliye" (Please don't speak)

**Key Difference:** Using "nahi" instead of "mat" for commands sounds unnatural.

---

## 18B. Softened Commands (Compound Imperatives)

### 18B-i. Adding "Lo/Lijiye" (Benefactive)

Makes the command sound like a suggestion for the listener's benefit.

> **Examples:**
> - "Kha lo" (Go ahead and eat - for your sake)
> - "Baith jaiye" (Please do sit down)
> - "Dekh lo" (Take a look - it's for you)

**Key Difference:** "Khao" is a direct order; "Kha lo" implies care/benefit.

---

### 18B-ii. Adding "Jao/Jaiye" (Completive)

Implies completing the action fully.

> **Examples:**
> - "Chup ho jao" (Become quiet - completely)
> - "So jao" (Go to sleep)
> - "Kar do" (Just do it - get it done)

---

### 18B-iii. Requests with "Please"

Using **zara** or **please** for politeness.

> **Examples:**
> - "Zara suniye" (Please listen for a moment)
> - "Zara ye dekho" (Just take a look at this)
> - "Please baith jaiye" (Please do sit)

---

## 18C. Permission & Polite Requests

### 18C-i. "Sakna" for Permission

> **Example:** "Kya main ja sakta hoon?"
> *(Can I go? / May I go?)*

---

### 18C-ii. "Dena" for Requesting Action

Using "dijiye" or "do na" to request.

> **Examples:**
> - "Mujhe bata dijiye" (Please tell me)
> - "Ye de do na" (Give this, won't you?)
> - "Ek baar aur samjha dijiye" (Please explain once more)

---

### 18C-iii. Indirect Requests

Using conditional structures for maximum politeness.

> **Examples:**
> - "Agar aap bata sakein to..." (If you could tell me...)
> - "Kya aap madad kar sakte hain?" (Could you help?)

**Key Difference:** This is formal/written; casual Hindi uses direct forms.

---

## 18D. Subjunctive Formation

### 18D-i. The Stem

The subjunctive is formed from the verb stem with specific endings for each person.

> **Conjugation Pattern (using "karna" - to do):**
>
> | Person | Form |
> |--------|------|
> | Main (I) | karoon |
> | Tu (You - intimate) | kare |
> | Vo (He/She) | kare |
> | Hum (We) | karein |
> | Aap (You - formal) | karein |

**Key Difference:** The subjunctive looks like the future tense **without the "Ga"** ending.

---

### 18D-ii. Third Person Singular/Plural

There is a distinction between singular and plural in the third person.

> **Singular:** "Vo aaye"
> **Plural:** "Ve aayein"

---

### 18D-iii. Irregular Roots

Some common verbs have **irregular subjunctive stems**.

> **Examples:**
> - *Lena* (to take) becomes **le**
> - *Dena* (to give) becomes **de**
> - *Hona* (to be) becomes **ho**

---

## 18E. Subjunctive Usage - Offers & Suggestions

### 18E-i. "Shall I?"

The subjunctive is used to ask for permission or offer to do something.

> **Example:** "Main chaloon?"
> *(Shall I leave?)*

---

### 18E-ii. Suggestion

Use the subjunctive to make **suggestions** or propose activities.

> **Example:** "Hum bahar khayein?"
> *(Shall we eat out?)*

---

### 18E-iii. Indirect Command

When reporting a command indirectly, the subjunctive must be used instead of the imperative.

> **Example:** "Use kaho ki vo chup rahe."
> *(Tell him to stay quiet.)*

**Key Difference:** You cannot use the imperative in indirect speech; the subjunctive is required.

---

## 18F. Subjunctive Usage - Uncertainty & Wishes

### 18F-i. Possibility

The subjunctive expresses **uncertainty** or **possibility**.

> **Example:** "Shayad vo aaj aaye."
> *(Maybe he comes today.)*

---

### 18F-ii. Wishes

For expressing **wishes** and **hypothetical desires**, Hindi uses the imperfective participle.

> **Example:** "Kaash main wahan hota."
> *(I wish I were there.)*

---

### 18F-iii. Purpose Clauses

The subjunctive appears in **purpose clauses** introduced by *taaki* (so that).

> **Example:** "Main mehnat karta hoon taaki safal ho sakoon."
> *(I work hard so that I may succeed.)*
