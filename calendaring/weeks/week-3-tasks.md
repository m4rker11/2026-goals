# Week 3: Evening Review

**Focus:** Track C (Output) + Track A (Input)
**One behavior:** Check calendar every evening, prepare tomorrow
**Success metric:** 5+ evenings out of 7

---

## The Principle

Morning check tells you what's happening. Evening review tells you what's COMING and lets you shape it.

This closes the loop: you're no longer just reacting to the day, you're preparing for the next one.

---

## The Behavior

### Trigger
Pick ONE consistent moment:
- After dinner
- Before winding down for bed
- When you sit on the couch for the evening
- A specific time (e.g., 9pm alarm)

### Action (5 minutes max)

1. **Look at tomorrow** - What's already scheduled?
2. **Fill gaps** - Anything missing? Add it now.
3. **Check tasks** - What todos need to happen tomorrow? Give them times.
4. **Quick week scan** - Anything in next 2-3 days you forgot about?

### Output
Tomorrow should look "real" - if someone looked at your calendar, they'd know what your day looks like.

## Evening Review Checklist

```
□ Open calendar
□ Look at tomorrow
□ Any appointments I know about that aren't there? Add them.
□ What time am I waking up? (put it as event or just note)
□ What's for dinner tomorrow? Who's handling it? (add if relevant)
□ Any gym/workout planned? (add time block)
□ Check tasks due tomorrow - do they have times?
□ Quick glance at day after tomorrow
□ Done
```

## The "Who's Handling Dinner" Addition

Since coordinating with Anuska is part of your goal:

- Each evening, decide: Who's doing dinner tomorrow?
- Add to calendar: "Dinner - Mark cooks" or "Dinner - Anuska handles"
- Or just "Dinner out" / "Leftovers"

This reduces next-day friction and decision fatigue.

## Trigger Ideas

| Trigger | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| Alarm at 9pm | Reliable but feels forced |
| After brushing teeth | Natural routine anchor |
| When Anuska starts her evening routine | Social cue |
| After dinner dishes done | Transition moment |
| When you close laptop for the night | Work → life boundary |

**Pick ONE.** Write it here: _________________________

## Daily Tracking

## What "Tomorrow Prepped" Means

At minimum:
- All known appointments are on calendar
- Dinner is decided
- If gym day, gym time is blocked

Bonus:
- Work start time is noted
- Key tasks have time slots
- Outfit/prep decisions made

---

## Common Failure Modes

| Failure | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Forgot to do it | Set phone alarm until habit forms |
| Too tired at night | Move earlier (right after dinner) |
| Felt like a chore | Keep it to 3 min, not 15 |
| Tomorrow looks empty | That's okay - awareness is the goal |
| Got anxious seeing tomorrow | Normal at first - this is info, not pressure |

---

## End of Week Reflection

1. **Compliance:** How many evenings? ___/7

2. **What trigger worked best?**

3. **How did tomorrow feel different when prepped?**

4. **Friction points:**

5. **Adjustment for Week 4:**

---

## Level Progress

| Track | Start of Week | End of Week |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| A: Input | A2-A3 | A3-A4 |
| C: Output | C3 | C4-C5 |

You now have **morning check + evening review** = C5 territory.

---

## Stack Check

By end of Week 3, you should be doing:
- Morning: Look at today (Week 1)
- Throughout: Add events immediately (Week 2)
- Evening: Review tomorrow (Week 3)

If any of these slipped, note it and keep practicing. The stack builds.
