# Unit 2: Questions and Descriptions

## Key Concepts
- **Interrogative words**: All start with 'k' sound
  - kya (what), kaun (who), kaisa/kaisi/kaise (what kind/how), kitna/kitni/kitne (how much/many), kyon (why)
- **Interrogative adjectives agree**: kaisa/kaisi/kaise and kitna/kitni/kitne match gender/number of noun
- **Mixed gender agreement**:
  - People: masculine plural takes priority (Rishi aur Sangeeta lambe hain)
  - Objects: adjective agrees with nearest noun
- **Honorific jii**: Added to names/titles for respect (Sharma ji, pitaji)
- **Particle bhii (also/too)**: Follows the word it qualifies
  - "Rishi bhii hoshiyar hai" = Rishi TOO is clever
  - "Rishi hoshiyar bhii hai" = Rishi is CLEVER too
- **Confirmation particle na**: End of sentence, expects agreement ("tum thik ho, na?")
- **Plural agreement with aap/tum**: These are grammatically plural even for one person
- **Log (people)**: Used to clarify numerical plural vs honorific plural (ham log = we people)
