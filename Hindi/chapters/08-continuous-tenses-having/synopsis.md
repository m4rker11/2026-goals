# Unit 8: Continuous Tenses and Having

## Key Concepts

### The Continuous Tenses
- Formation: Verb Stem + raha/rahi/rahe + auxiliary (hai/tha)
- raha (m.sg.), rahi (f.sg./pl.), rahe (m.pl./honorific)
- Present continuous: ham log hindi sikh rahe hain (we are learning Hindi)
- Past continuous: tum galat nambar mila rahe the (you were dialling wrong number)
- Phone identification: mai Usha bol rahi hu (this is Usha speaking)

### Expressions for "To Have"
Hindi uses hona (to be) with three constructions:
1. **ko** - illnesses/conditions: Pinkie ko zukam hai (Pinkie has a cold)
2. **ke pas** - portable items, money, time, servants: Raj ke pas bahut khilaune hain (Raj has lots of toys)
3. **ka/ki/ke** - relatives, houses, body parts: Ram ke do bhai hain (Ram has two brothers)

### Adverbial Phrases
- Oblique case without postposition in time expressions: us din (on that day)
- Destination of motion verbs takes oblique: Agra -> Agre jana
- This morning/evening = aj subah/sham (NOT is/yeh)

### Telling Dates
- 1st/2nd use feminine ordinals (pahli/dusri) - agrees with tarik (date)
- From 3rd onward use cardinal numbers
- Years: san + number (san do hazar das = 2010)

### Word Order
- Basic: Subject-Adverb-Indirect Object-Direct Object-Verb
- Moving element before verb adds emphasis
- kya can go at end for informal question tone

### Colloquial Usage
- vah often pronounced "vo" and used as plural
- ap + tum verb form = friendly formal (ap baitho)
- ham used instead of mai (royal we)
- Distinguish dental (d) vs retroflex (D), aspirated vs non-aspirated

## Vocab Theme
Locations (lanes, hotels), body states (illness), family/relatives, portable possessions, food items (sabzi, gosht), city names

## Dialogue Context
- 8a: Arun meets Rafiq in Lucknow lanes - discussing book project, staying at brother's place, being hassled by children
- 8b: Prakash tells Kamala that Khanna Sahib is coming for dinner - shopping needs, family arrangements

## Exercises
- Converting imperfective to continuous verbs
- Translation with possession constructions
- Dialogue completion (phone conversation from Kathmandu)
- Postposition vs adverb pairs (ghar ke bahar vs bahar)
