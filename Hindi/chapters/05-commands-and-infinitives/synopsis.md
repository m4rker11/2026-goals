# Unit 5: Commands and Infinitives

## Key Concepts
- **Infinitive verb form**: Stem + -naa (bolnaa = to speak, stem is bol-)
- **Command forms** (imperative) by politeness level:
  - tu: stem alone (bol, sun, jaa) - intimate/blunt
  - tum: stem + -o (bolo, suno, jao) - standard informal
  - aap: stem + -ie (bolie, sunie, aaie) - polite
  - aap + -iegaa: extra polite (boliegaa = please be so kind as to speak)
  - Infinitive as deferred command: "bolnaa" = speak later
- **Negative commands**: mat (don't) with tum/tu, na with aap
  - "tu chaay mat pii" = don't drink tea
  - "sigreT na piijie" = don't smoke
- **Possession with kaa/ke/kii**:
  - Shows 's or "of" - agrees with possessed noun
  - "bacce kaa kuttaa" = the child's dog
  - "bacce kii kitaab" = the child's book
  - Preceding noun goes oblique (bacca -> bacce)
- **ko with objects**:
  - Indirect object: "Raaj ko chaabii do" = Give the key to Raj
  - Specific/definite direct object: "paanii ko piyo" = Drink THE water (vs "paanii piyo" = drink water)
  - Human direct objects almost always take ko
- **Short pronoun+ko forms**: mujhko = mujhe, tumko = tumhe, usko = use (interchangeable)

## Vocab Theme
Verbs (aana, baithnaa, denaa, piinaa, kahnaa, sunnaa, likhnaaa, khaanaa, paDhnaa, maarnaa, bulaanaa), household (daraazaa, chaabii, kambal, thailaa), food/drink (doodh, chaay, paanii, samosa)

## Dialogue Context
- 5a: Kamala hosts neighbor Suresh for lunch, giving commands to son Raj about sitting and drinking
- 3a/3b: Boys searching for house keys - commands, possession, and location
