    notes: "Hit 70 min (35 Wed + 35 Sun) vs 65 target. Procrastinated but delivered. Screenless Sunday perfect for workouts w/ ADHD meds. PT stretches skipped - lack of equipment at brother's + low motivation. Environment issue: less structure at brother's → high dopamine defaults (YouTube, reels) → worse sleep/diet."
