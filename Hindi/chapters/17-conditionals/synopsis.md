# Unit 17: Conditionals and Compound Verbs

## Key Concepts

### Conditional Sentences (Counter-to-Fact)

**Perfective in agar clause = supposition**
- agar kuch garam pani baqi raha to mai bhi naha lunga (If there's hot water left, I'll bathe too)
- agar tumhe chatravrtti mili to Bharat jao (If you get the scholarship, go to India)

**Imperfective participle without auxiliary = hypothetical/unfulfilled**
- tum mujhe bulate to mai zarur ata (If you called me, I would come / If you had called me, I would have come)
- mai kavi hota to tere bare me kavita likhta (If I were a poet, I'd write poetry about you)

**Past timeframe for unfulfilled conditions**
- Pattern: Perfective participle + hota ... to + Imperfective participle
- tum 10 baje aae hote to unse bat kar pate (If you'd come at 10, you'd have been able to talk to them)
- vah dhyan se parhi hoti to use digri mil jati (If she'd studied attentively, she would have got a degree)
