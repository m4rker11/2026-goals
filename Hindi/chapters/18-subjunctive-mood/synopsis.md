## 18A. Formation

### 18A-i. The Stem

The subjunctive is formed from the verb stem with specific endings for each person.

> **Conjugation Pattern (using "karna" - to do):**
>
> | Person | Form |
> |--------|------|
> | Main (I) | karoon |
> | Tu (You - intimate) | kare |
> | Vo (He/She) | kare |
> | Hum (We) | karein |
> | Aap (You - formal) | karein |

**Key Difference:** The subjunctive looks like the future tense **without the "Ga"** ending.

---

### 18A-ii. Third Person Singular/Plural

There is a distinction between singular and plural in the third person.

> **Singular:** "Vo aaye"
> **Plural:** "Ve aayein"

---

### 18A-iii. Irregular Roots

Some common verbs have **irregular subjunctive stems**.

> **Examples:**
> - *Lena* (to take) becomes **le**
> - *Dena* (to give) becomes **de**
> - *Hona* (to be) becomes **ho**

## 18B. Usage - Permission & Suggestions

### 18B-ii. Suggestion

Use the subjunctive to make **suggestions** or propose activities.

### 18B-iii. Indirect Command

When reporting a command indirectly, the subjunctive must be used instead of the imperative.
