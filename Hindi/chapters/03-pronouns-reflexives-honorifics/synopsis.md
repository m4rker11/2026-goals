# Chapter 3: Pronouns, Reflexives & Honorifics

> Beyond "You" and "I".

---

## 3A. The Hierarchy of "You"

### 3A-i. Tu (Intimate/Divine/Insulting)

Only for God, very close childhood friends, or abuse.

> **Example:** "Tu kahan hai?"

*Difference:* Misuse causes major social offense.

---

### 3A-ii. Tum (Familiar)

Friends, younger family, peers.

> **Example:** "Tum kahan ho?"

*Difference:* Verb agreement is "ho" (plural logic), unlike "hai".

---

### 3A-iii. Aap (Respect/Formal)

Elders, strangers, seniors.

> **Example:** "Aap kahan hain?"

*Difference:* Always takes 3rd Person Plural verb forms ("hain", "aayenge").

---

## 3B. The "Apna" Reflexive (Self-Ownership)

### 3B-i. The Basic Rule

When the subject owns the object.

> **Example:** "Main apni gadi chalata hoon" (I drive my car)

*Difference:* If you say "Main meri gadi...", it sounds redundant to a native ear.

---

### 3B-ii. Third Person Ambiguity

Distinguishing distinct owners.

> **Example:** "Ram ne apni kitab padhi" (Ram read his own book) vs. "Ram ne uski kitab padhi" (Ram read someone else's book)

*Difference:* In English, "his book" is ambiguous. In Hindi, "Apna" vs "Uska" resolves it.

---

### 3B-iii. The "Apne Aap" Idiom

Action done by oneself.

> **Example:** "Darwaza apne aap khul gaya" (The door opened by itself)

*Difference:* Here "Apne aap" functions as an adverb meaning "automatically".

---

## 3C. Demonstrative Pronouns

### 3C-i. Proximal (Yeh/Ye)

This/These/He/She (Close)

> **Example:** "Yeh mera bhai hai."

*Difference:* Used for physical closeness or immediate topic relevance.

---

### 3C-ii. Distal (Voh/Ve)

That/Those/He/She (Far)

> **Example:** "Voh mera dost hai."

*Difference:* Also functions as the default "He/She" regardless of distance if not physically present.

---

### 3C-iii. The "Ye/Ve" Plural Clarity

Spoken Hindi often merges singular/plural pronunciation.

> **Example:** "Ye log" (These people) vs "Vo log" (Those people)

*Difference:* Adding "log" (people) is a common B2 strategy to clarify plurality when pronouns sound similar.

## 3D. The Dative Experiencer Construction

> **Why this matters:** Hindi expresses many experiences (liking, knowing, feeling) with the experiencer in the dative case, not as the subject. This is one of Hindi's most distinctive patterns.

### 3D-i. The Core Pattern

The experiencer takes **ko/mujhe/use** (dative), and the verb agrees with the stimulus, not the experiencer.

| English | Hindi | Literal |
|---------|-------|---------|
| I like tea | Mujhe chai pasand hai | To-me tea liked is |
| She knows | Use pataa hai | To-her known is |
| We are hungry | Hame bhook lagi hai | To-us hunger attached is |

**Key Difference:** English "I like X" → Hindi "To-me X is liked". The verb agrees with X.

---

### 3D-ii. Liking (Pasand & Accha Lagna)

Two constructions for expressing preference:

> **Pasand hona (static liking):**
> - "Mujhe ye film pasand hai" (I like this film)
> - "Use Hindi pasand nahi" (He doesn't like Hindi)

> **Accha lagna (pleasing/appealing):**
> - "Mujhe ye gaana accha lagta hai" (I find this song nice)
> - "Tumhe kaisa laga?" (How did you find it? / Did you like it?)

**Key Difference:** *Pasand hai* = established preference. *Accha lagta hai* = appeals to me / I find it nice.

---

### 3D-iii. Knowing (Pataa, Maaloom, Jaanna, Aana)

Four distinct "know" constructions:

| Construction | Meaning | Example |
|--------------|---------|---------|
| **Pataa hona** | Know a fact | "Mujhe pataa hai" (I know) |
| **Maaloom hona** | Be aware | "Mujhe maaloom hai" (I'm aware) |
| **Jaanna** | Know (person/thing) | "Main use jaanta hoon" (I know him) |
| **Aana** | Know how to (skill) | "Mujhe Hindi aati hai" (I know Hindi) |

> **Examples:**
> - "Kya tumhe pataa hai?" (Do you know? - about a fact)
> - "Main nahi jaanta" (I don't know - person/thing)
> - "Mujhe gaadi chalani aati hai" (I know how to drive)

**Key Difference:** *Jaanna* takes a normal subject (Main). The others take dative (Mujhe).

---

### 3D-iv. Physical Sensations (Lagna)

The verb **lagna** (to attach/strike) expresses bodily sensations.

| Sensation | Construction | Example |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| Hunger | Bhook lagna | "Mujhe bhook lagi hai" (I'm hungry) |
| Thirst | Pyaas lagna | "Use pyaas lagi hai" (He's thirsty) |
| Cold | Thand lagna | "Mujhe thand lag rahi hai" (I'm feeling cold) |
| Heat | Garmi lagna | "Bacchon ko garmi lag rahi hai" (The kids are feeling hot) |
| Fear | Dar lagna | "Mujhe dar lagta hai" (I feel scared) |
| Sleepiness | Neend aana | "Mujhe neend aa rahi hai" (I'm feeling sleepy) |

**Key Difference:** English "I am hungry" (adjective) → Hindi "To-me hunger has-attached" (verb).

---

### 3D-v. Emotions & States

Other common dative experiencer expressions:

| Emotion/State | Construction | Example |
|---------------|--------------|---------|
| Anger | Gussa aana | "Mujhe gussa aa raha hai" (I'm getting angry) |
| Happiness | Khushi hona | "Mujhe bahut khushi hui" (I was very happy) |
| Surprise | Hairani hona | "Mujhe hairani hui" (I was surprised) |
| Boredom | Bore hona | "Mujhe bore ho raha hai" (I'm getting bored) |
| Worry | Chinta hona | "Mujhe chinta hai" (I'm worried) |
| Shame | Sharm aana | "Mujhe sharm aati hai" (I feel ashamed) |
