*Will, Want, and Presumption.*

## 10A. Simple Future

### 10A-i. Gender/Number Agreement

> **Example:** "Ladka jayega, Ladki jayegi, Hum jayenge."

---

### 10A-ii. The "Ga" of Certainty

> **Example:** "Main zaroor aaoonga."

---

### 10A-iii. Future as Command

> **Example:** "Tum wahin rukoge!" (You will stay there!).

**Key difference:** Using Future tense as a strict order.

---

## 10B. Presumptive Future

### 10B-i. Assessing Present

> **Example:** "Vo parh raha hoga" (He must be reading).

---

### 10B-ii. Assessing Past

> **Example:** "Usne khana kha liya hoga" (He must have eaten).

**Key difference:** Structure looks Future (*Hoga*), but meaning is Past Deduction.

---

### 10B-iii. Doubt vs Certainty

---

## 10C. Intentional Future

### 10C-i. "Wala" Future

> **Example:** "Main jane wala hoon" (I am about to go).

**Key difference:** Immediate future, closer than *Jaoonga*.

### 10C-ii. Negative Refusal

> **Example:** "Main nahin jane wala" (I am not going to go / I refuse).

**Key difference:** Emphatic refusal.

---

### 10C-iii. "Ja raha hoon" as Future
