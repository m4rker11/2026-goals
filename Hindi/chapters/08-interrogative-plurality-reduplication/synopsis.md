# Chapter 8: Interrogative Plurality & Reduplication

*Why this matters: This fits with "Adjectives" because it describes how things are done.*

---

## 8A. Question Plurality

### 8A-i. List Expectation: "Tumne kya-kya khaya?"

> **Meaning:** "What all did you eat?" (Lists items).

**Key difference:** *Kya khaya* asks for one thing; *Kya-kya* asks for the menu.

---

### 8A-ii. Person Plurality: "Kaun-kaun aa raha hai?"

> **Meaning:** "Who all are coming?"

---

### 8A-iii. Location Plurality: "Kahan-kahan gaye the?"

> **Meaning:** "Where all did you go?"

---

## 8B. Action Reduplication (Participles)

### 8B-i. While doing X: "Chalte-chalte" (While walking)

> **Example:** "Chalte-chalte batatein hain."

---

### 8B-ii. Idle State: "Baithe-baithe"

> **Example:** "Main baithe-baithe thak gaya" (I got tired just sitting around).

**Key difference:** Implies doing nothing else, or idleness.

---

### 8B-iii. Gradualness: "Hote-hote" (Gradually happening)

> **Example:** "Hote-hote ho gaya" (It happened gradually/eventually).

---

## 8C. Echo Words (Approximation)

### 8C-i. The "V-Echo": "Chai-wai", "Khana-wana"

> **Meaning:** "Tea and stuff", "Food and such".

**Key difference:** The second word starts with 'V' (or 'W') and has no meaning, just adds "et cetera".

---

### 8C-ii. Antonym Pairs: "Din-Raat" (Day and Night / Continuously)

> **Example:** "Vo din-raat padhta hai."
