# Options Trading: Overview

## The Goal

Execute one options trade every 2 weeks for 2 months. Build the habit, not the fortune.

---

## Current State → Target

| Level | Description | You |
|-------|-------------|-----|
| L1 | Have brokerage, traded before | |
| **L2** | Trade occasionally when reminded | **← Now** |
| L3 | Watchlist exists, trades happen but inconsistent | |
| **L4** | Routine exists: check-in → decide → execute → reflect | **← Target** |
| L5 | Systematic, automatic, integrated into life | |

---

## The Gaps (From Diagnostic)

| Gap | Blocker It Causes | Fix |
|-----|-------------------|-----|
| No default strategy | Analysis paralysis | **Fixed:** Calls/puts on momentum |
| No regular check-in | Forgot | Add weekly calendar event |
| No reflection habit | Don't learn | 3-sentence post-trade note |
| Shaky accountability | Easy to skip | Message BuffedApe before trades |

---

## Default Strategy

**Calls/puts on momentum** - keep it simple.

- Look at your watchlist
- Find something moving (up or down)
- Buy call if bullish, buy put if bearish
- Small position sizes (learning, not earning)

---

## Timeline

| Period | Dates | Trade Deadline | Phase Focus |
|--------|-------|----------------|-------------|
| **1** | Jan 13-24 | Jan 24 | Pick a Lane (use default strategy) |
| **2** | Jan 27 - Feb 7 | Feb 7 | Add Routine (weekly check-in) |
| **3** | Feb 10-21 | Feb 21 | Add Reflection |
| **4** | Feb 24 - Mar 7 | Mar 7 | Full System |

---

## Weekly Routine (5-10 min)

| Day | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **Monday** | 5-min market scan. What's moving on your list? |
| **Friday** | Execute trade if in trade week. Message BuffedApe first. |
| **After close** | 3 sentences: What happened? What did I learn? What next? |

## Tradeable Watchlist

*Tickers you're watching for momentum:*

| Ticker | Why It's Here |
|--------|---------------|

## Trade Log

| Period | Ticker | Direction | Entry | Exit | P/L | Lesson |
|--------|--------|-----------|-------|------|-----|--------|
| 1 | | | | | | |
| 2 | | | | | | |
| 3 | | | | | | |
| 4 | | | | | | |

---

## Success Metrics

- **Primary:** 4/4 trades executed
- **Secondary:** Reflection written for each
- **Bonus:** Net positive P/L

---

## Key Principle

> **Minimize decision fatigue. Default strategy means you're deciding "which ticker" not "what kind of trade."**

If it feels stressful, position size is too big.
