# Chapter 3: Pronouns, Reflexives & Honorifics

> Beyond "You" and "I".

---

## 3A. The Hierarchy of "You"

### 3A-i. Tu (Intimate/Divine/Insulting)

Only for God, very close childhood friends, or abuse.

> **Example:** "Tu kahan hai?"

*Difference:* Misuse causes major social offense.

---

### 3A-ii. Tum (Familiar)

Friends, younger family, peers.

> **Example:** "Tum kahan ho?"

*Difference:* Verb agreement is "ho" (plural logic), unlike "hai".

---

### 3A-iii. Aap (Respect/Formal)

Elders, strangers, seniors.

> **Example:** "Aap kahan hain?"

*Difference:* Always takes 3rd Person Plural verb forms ("hain", "aayenge").

---

## 3B. The "Apna" Reflexive (Self-Ownership)

### 3B-i. The Basic Rule

When the subject owns the object.

> **Example:** "Main apni gadi chalata hoon" (I drive my car)

*Difference:* If you say "Main meri gadi...", it sounds redundant to a native ear.

---

### 3B-ii. Third Person Ambiguity

Distinguishing distinct owners.

> **Example:** "Ram ne apni kitab padhi" (Ram read his own book) vs. "Ram ne uski kitab padhi" (Ram read someone else's book)

*Difference:* In English, "his book" is ambiguous. In Hindi, "Apna" vs "Uska" resolves it.

---

### 3B-iii. The "Apne Aap" Idiom

Action done by oneself.

> **Example:** "Darwaza apne aap khul gaya" (The door opened by itself)

*Difference:* Here "Apne aap" functions as an adverb meaning "automatically".

---

## 3C. Demonstrative Pronouns

### 3C-i. Proximal (Yeh/Ye)

This/These/He/She (Close)

> **Example:** "Yeh mera bhai hai."

*Difference:* Used for physical closeness or immediate topic relevance.

---

### 3C-ii. Distal (Voh/Ve)

That/Those/He/She (Far)

> **Example:** "Voh mera dost hai."

*Difference:* Also functions as the default "He/She" regardless of distance if not physically present.

---

### 3C-iii. The "Ye/Ve" Plural Clarity

Spoken Hindi often merges singular/plural pronunciation.

> **Example:** "Ye log" (These people) vs "Vo log" (Those people)

*Difference:* Adding "log" (people) is a common B2 strategy to clarify plurality when pronouns sound similar.
