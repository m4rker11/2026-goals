# Chapter 16: Modals I - Capability & Success

**Focus:** Can vs. Manage

---

## 16A. Sakna (Can)

### 16A-i. Physical Ability

The verb *sakna* expresses inherent capability or physical ability to do something.

> **Example:** "Main daud sakta hoon."
> *(I can run.)*

---

### 16A-ii. Permission

*Sakna* is also used to ask for or express permission.

> **Example:** "Kya main ja sakta hoon?"
> *(Can I go? / May I go?)*

---

### 16A-iii. Possibility

When expressing that something is possible, *sakna* takes an impersonal form.

> **Example:** "Ho sakta hai."
> *(It is possible.)*

---

## 16B. Paana (Manage/Acquire)

### 16B-i. Success in Action

*Paana* indicates that someone **managed** to do something, often implying effort or overcoming an obstacle.

> **Example:** "Main nahin aa paya."
> *(I couldn't make it.)*

**Key Difference:** *Saka* is neutral about difficulty; *paya* implies a distinct effort or hurdle was involved.

---

### 16B-ii. Often Negative

*Paana* appears in **negative sentences about 90% of the time** when discussing ability.

> This construction emphasizes that despite effort, the action could not be completed.

---

### 16B-iii. Opportunity

*Paana* can also express whether someone got the **chance** or **opportunity** to do something.

> **Example:** "Tum mil paye?"
> *(Did you get the chance to meet?)*

---

## 16C. Passive Capability (Mujhse...)

### 16C-i. Inability

This construction expresses that an action **cannot be done** by someone due to physical limitation, not choice.

> **Example:** "Mujhse khaya nahin jata."
> *(I simply cannot eat.)* [too full/sick]

**Key Difference:** This suggests a physical blocking rather than a deliberate choice not to act.

---

### 16C-ii. Emotional Block

The same construction expresses inability to do something due to **emotional reasons**.

> **Example:** "Mujhse use dekha nahin gaya."
> *(I couldn't bear to watch him.)*

---

### 16C-iii. Positive Capability (Rare)

In rare cases, this passive construction can express positive capability.

> **Example:** "Mujhse yeh ho jata hai."
> *(I manage to do this.)*
