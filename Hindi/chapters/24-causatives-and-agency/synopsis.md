# Chapter 24: Causatives & Agency

**Goal:** Getting things done.

---

## 24A. Direct Causative (First Level)

### 24A-i. "-ana" Suffix

> **Example:** *Padhna* (Read) becomes *Padhana* (To teach/cause to read)

**Key Difference:** Adding *-ana* creates "to make someone do X."

---

### 24A-ii. Semantics

> **Example:** *Khilana* (Feed) from *Khana* (Eat)

| Base Verb | Meaning | Causative | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|-----------|---------|
| Khana | To eat | Khilana | To feed |
| Padhna | To read | Padhana | To teach |
| Sunna | To hear | Sunana | To tell/narrate |

---

### 24A-iii. Object Marking

> **Example:** "Maa bachche ko khana khilati hai."
> *(Mother feeds food to the child.)*

---

## 24B. Indirect Causative (Second Level)

### 24B-i. "-vana" Suffix

> **Example:** *Padhvana* (To make someone read / get something read)

**Key Difference:** This involves a third party - you're causing someone else to cause the action.

---

### 24B-ii. Mediator "Se"

> **Example:** "Maine Ram se chitti likhvayi"
> *(I had Ram write the letter.)*

**Key Difference:** The person doing the work is marked with *Se*.

---

### 24B-iii. Service/Repair

> **Example:** "Gadi thik karvana"
> *(Get the car fixed.)*

This is extremely common for services:
- *Kapde dhulvana* - Get clothes washed
- *Baal katvana* - Get a haircut
- *Khana banvana* - Get food made

---

## 24C. False Causatives

### 24C-i. Verbs That Look Causative

> **Example:** *Bulana* (To call/invite)

**Key Difference:** Looks like "Make speak" (from *Bolna*), but the meaning is actually "to call/invite."

---

### 24C-ii. Double Transitives

> **Example:** *Samajhna* (Understand) becomes *Samjhana* (Explain)

These are not true causatives but transitive pairs:

| Base Verb | Meaning | Derivative | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|------------|---------|
| Samajhna | To understand | Samjhana | To explain |
| Seekhna | To learn | Sikhana | To teach |

---

## Summary: Causative Levels

| Level | Suffix | Example | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|---------|
| Base | - | Padhna | To read |
| Direct Causative | -ana | Padhana | To teach (make read) |
| Indirect Causative | -vana | Padhvana | To get read (through someone) |
