# Unit 9: Future Tense

## Key Concepts

### The Future Tense
- Single word, no auxiliary needed
- Masculine endings: -unga (mai), -ega (vah), -oge (tum), -enge (ham/ve)
- Feminine: replace final -a with -i
- Example: mai bolunga (I will speak m.), vah bolegi (she will speak)
- Irregular: hona -> hunga, lena -> loge, dena -> denge
- Stems ending in u/i shorten: chuna -> chuega, pina -> piega

### Future in Auxiliary
- Future continuous: V-stem + raha/rahi/rahe + hoga
- vah ja raha hoga = he will be going
- Contrasts with present (hai) and past (tha) continuous

### Presumptive Uses of Future
- Future tense often means "must be" or "presumably"
- vah admi hamara parosi hoga = that man must be our neighbor
- bacce so rahe honge = the kids must be sleeping
- Not always future time - can express assumption about present

### The Emphatic hi
- Emphasizes/restricts preceding word
- mai hi = I myself / only I
- bahut hi accha = very good indeed
- ek hi makan = only one house
- Coalesced forms: vahI (that very one), yahI (this very one), yahIn (right here), abhI (right now)
- Does NOT trigger oblique case

### Expressions of Quantity
- bahut-sa/si/se clarifies "many" vs "very": bahut-si kitaben = many books
- -sa suffix = "-ish" or "quite": lal-si roshni = reddish light
- bahut zyada = too much, bahut kam = too little
- kam se kam = at least, zyada se zyada = at most

### Infinitive as Verbal Noun
- Infinitive (-na) functions as masculine noun
- Direct case as subject: sigreT pina mana hai (smoking is prohibited)
- Oblique (-ne) before postpositions: ghar pahunchne par (upon arriving home)
- Oblique for purpose: mai khana khane bahar jaungi (I'll go out to eat)
- -ne (ke) layaq = worth doing: yah kitab parhne layaq hai
- ko + infinitive + ana = to know how: mujhe tairna ata hai (I can swim)

## Vocab Theme
Cinema, family visits, book publishing (pratiya, prachar, vitaran), relatives (bhatija = nephew), emotions (mushkil, nuqsan)

## Dialogue Context
- 9a: Pinkie invites Sangeeta to cinema but family is coming for dinner - navigating parental expectations, Harish the nephew
- 9b: Arun and Prem discuss their book being printed in Varanasi - distribution, sales expectations, pessimism vs optimism
