# Week 5: Check Before Committing

**Focus:** Track C (Output) - calendar becomes authoritative
**One behavior:** "Let me check my calendar" before ANY commitment
**Success metric:** Zero double-bookings, zero "oh I forgot I had..."

---

## The Principle

The calendar is only useful if you TRUST it. And you only trust it if you USE it as the source of truth.

This week: before saying yes to ANYTHING with a time component, you check.

---

## The Behavior

### Trigger
Someone asks you to do something at a specific time:
- "Can you meet Thursday at 2?"
- "Want to grab lunch tomorrow?"
- "Are you free this weekend?"
- Boss: "Can you join this call?"

### Action
PAUSE. Say: "Let me check my calendar."

Then actually check.

### Output
- If free: "Yes, that works. Let me add it now." (Week 2 skill!)
- If busy: "I have something at 2, how about 3?"
- If unsure: "Let me confirm and get back to you in 5 minutes."

## The Magic Phrase

**"Let me check my calendar."**

Practice saying this. It's not weird. It's professional. It signals you're organized.

Variations:
- "One sec, checking my calendar..."
- "Let me pull up my schedule..."
- "Hold on, I want to make sure I'm free..."

## Why This Matters

| Without This | With This |
|--------------|-----------|
| Double-book constantly | Conflicts caught before they happen |
| "I think I'm free?" | "I know I'm free." |
| Overcommit, then scramble | Realistic commitments |
| Calendar feels unreliable | Calendar becomes authoritative |

---

## Practice Scenarios

This week, consciously use "let me check" for:

- [ ] Work meeting requests
- [ ] Friend/social invitations
- [ ] Anuska suggesting plans
- [ ] Doctor/appointment scheduling
- [ ] Any "are you free on X?"

Even if you KNOW you're free, check anyway. Build the muscle.

---

## The Quick-Check Flow

1. Request comes in → "Let me check"
2. Open calendar (phone widget, voice, browser)
3. Look at that day/time
4. Give answer
5. If yes → Add it NOW (Week 2)

Total time: 15 seconds.

## Daily Tracking

{% include todo-list.html goal="calendar" unit="week-5" %}

## Handling the Awkward

| Situation | What to Do |
|-----------|------------|
| Someone's waiting impatiently | "One second" - it takes 10 sec |
| Feel embarrassed checking | Remember: this is professional |
| Phone is dead/unavailable | "Let me get back to you in 5 min" |
| You want to say yes immediately | Still check. Build the habit. |

---

## Signs It's Working

By end of week, you should notice:
- [ ] Zero "oh no I double-booked"
- [ ] Feeling more in control of commitments
- [ ] Calendar feels like the truth
- [ ] You check reflexively, not consciously

---

## End of Week Reflection

1. **Compliance:** How often did you check before committing? ___%

2. **Caught any conflicts?**

3. **Awkward moments?**

4. **What made it easier:**

5. **What made it harder:**

---

## Level Progress

| Track | Start of Week | End of Week |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| C: Output | C5 | C5-C6 |
| Trust | Building | Established |

The calendar is now **authoritative**.

---

## Stack Check

By end of Week 5, you should be doing:
- [ ] Morning: Look at today
- [ ] Throughout: Add events immediately
- [ ] Throughout: Check before committing ← NEW
- [ ] Evening: Review tomorrow

You're now operating at a high level. Week 6 adds the final piece: weekly planning.
