# Chapter 13: The "Compulsion" Matrix

**Have to, Must, Should, Supposed to.**

---

## 13A. External Compulsion (Padna)

### 13A-i. Present Force

Expresses routine or habitual compulsion from external circumstances.

> **Example:**
> "Mujhe roz dawai khani padti hai" (I have to take medicine daily)

**Key Difference:** This indicates routine/habitual compulsion.

---

### 13A-ii. One-time Force

Describes a single instance of compulsion in the past.

> **Example:**
> "Kal mujhe bank jana pada" (Yesterday I had to go to the bank)

**Key Difference:** A past definite event, not a recurring obligation.

---

### 13A-iii. Future Inevitability

Expresses that something *will* have to happen.

> **Example:**
> "Tumhe manna padega" (You will have to agree)

---

## 13B. Moral/Internal Duty (Chahiye)

### 13B-i. Advice

Used for giving suggestions or recommendations.

> **Example:**
> "Tumhe aaram karna chahiye" (You should rest)

---

### 13B-ii. Past Regret

Adding *tha* transforms advice into regret or blame.

> **Example:**
> "Tumhe batana chahiye tha" (You should have told)

**Key Difference:** Adding "tha" turns advice into regret or blame for past inaction.

---

### 13B-iii. Want vs Need

The structure determines the meaning.

> **Example:**
> "Mujhe pani chahiye" (I need/want water)

**Key Difference:**
- **Object + Chahiye** = Need
- **Verb + Chahiye** = Should

---

## 13C. Logical Necessity (Hoga/Hai)

### 13C-i. "Na" + Hai Structure

Expresses a plan or intention, milder than *Padta hai*.

> **Example:**
> "Mujhe abhi jana hai" (I have to go now)

**Key Difference:** Milder than "Padta hai" - shows plan/intent rather than external force.

---

### 13C-ii. "Na" + Tha Structure

Indicates what was supposed to happen.

> **Example:**
> "Mujhe milna tha" (I was supposed to meet)

---

### 13C-iii. "Na" + Hoga

Expresses future necessity.

> **Example:**
> "Mujhe wahan hona hoga" (I will have to be there)
